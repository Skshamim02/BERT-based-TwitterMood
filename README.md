Twitter Elon Musk Controversy Sentiment Analysis
This repository contains code and analyses for sentiment analysis on the recent controversy surrounding Elon Musk and Twitter. Using various machine learning models, we aim to understand public sentiment on this topic, based on data collected from Twitter.

Project Overview:

In light of the recent events involving Elon Musk and Twitter, public opinion has been divided. Our project seeks to quantify this sentiment through the application of several sentiment analysis models, providing insights into how different demographics and user groups perceive the controversy.

Data Collection:

Tweets were collected using the Twitter API, focusing on keywords such as "Elon Musk", "Twitter", "controversy", and other relevant terms. The dataset spans a period from [start date] to [end date], capturing the evolution of public opinion over time.

Models Used:
We employed a variety of models to ensure a comprehensive analysis:

Naive Bayes Classifier: A baseline model for sentiment classification.
LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory): To capture temporal dependencies in tweet sentiment.
BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers): A state-of-the-art model for understanding the context of words in tweets.

Our analysis focuses on:

Sentiment Over Time: Tracking how public sentiment has evolved during the controversy period.
Demographic Insights: Understanding if sentiment differs significantly across various user demographics.
Topic Modeling: Identifying key themes within the controversy that drive positive or negative sentiment.
