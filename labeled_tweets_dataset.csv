16,@KanekoaTheGreat,"Judge Kathaleen McCormick rescinded Elon Musk's $55 billion Tesla compensation package, overturning the company's board and 80% of its shareholders.  McCormick also ruled against @elonmusk during his Twitter acquisition.  Before becoming the head of the Delaware Chancery Court, McCormick worked at a Delaware law firm called Young Conaway.  This firm and its employees have been major donors to President Joe Biden for decades.  In 2016, Hunter Biden hosted a gubernatorial campaign event for Congressman John Carney, with then-Vice President Joe Biden as the guest speaker.  This event took place at the Law Offices of Young Conaway in Wilmington, Delaware.  Carney, a close friend of Joe Biden for the last four decades, later became governor and nominated Kathaleen McCormick, a partner at Young Conaway, to her position on the Delaware Chancery Court.  In a March 2018 email, Hunter Biden claimed to personally know every judge on the Delaware Chancery Court while threatening legal action against his Chinese business partners.  ""I will bring the suit in the Chancery court in Delaware - which as you know is my home state and I am privileged to have worked with and know every judge on the chancery court.""  After Elon Musk purchased Twitter with the stated goal of restoring free-speech, President Biden called for a federal investigation into Musk on the podium at the White House.  Following this, the Biden Department of Justice, Securities and Exchange Commission, and Federal Trade Commission initiated legal actions and investigations against Tesla, SpaceX, and X.  This recent decision by Judge McCormick, who worked with Biden's top donors and was nominated by Biden's close friend, to override Tesla's board and the majority of its shareholders is another clear example of the Biden administration and its allies weaponizing the American legal system against their political opponents.",judge kathaleen mccormick rescinded elon musk 55 billion tesla compensation package overturning company board 80 shareholder mccormick also ruled elonmusk twitter acquisition becoming head delaware chancery court mccormick worked delaware law firm called young conaway firm employee major donor president joe biden decade 2016 hunter biden hosted gubernatorial campaign event congressman john carney president joe biden guest speaker event took place law office young conaway wilmington delaware carney close friend joe biden last four decade later became governor nominated kathaleen mccormick partner young conaway position delaware chancery court march 2018 email hunter biden claimed personally know every judge delaware chancery court threatening legal action chinese business partner bring suit chancery court delaware know home state privileged worked know every judge chancery court elon musk purchased twitter stated goal restoring president biden called federal investigation musk podium white house following biden department justice security exchange commission federal trade commission initiated legal action investigation tesla spacex x recent decision judge mccormick worked biden top donor nominated biden close friend override tesla board majority shareholder another clear example biden administration ally weaponizing american legal system political opponent,positive

Who would not want that? I know it's frustrating for Elon as it was his performance compensation and he delivered on the performance, but I don't see a way he is not made whole in this.

420,@farzyness,"Delaware's ruling on Elon Musk's $55B comp package is a big loss for Tesla investors.  A court in Delaware has ruled to rescind Elon Muskâs $55 BILLION pay package that was approved by shareholders in 2018. As of 2024, Elon Musk has reached the necessary goals to be awarded the amount by hitting numerous targets laid out by the plan. As of this date, a very large majority of the package has yet to be paid out..  An important definition that we need to make is on the word ârescindedâ. Rescinded means that Tesla and the plaintiff (the person who brought the original case to trial) have to go back to the drawing board and ârewriteâ the original comp package so that it fulfills the below criteria laid out by the judge:  - The amount paid to Elon is âfairâ. - Tesla needs to be more transparent about the relationship between Elon and the Board of Directions, due to Elon having long-time relationships with many of the members that were responsible for drafting the pay package for Elon.  The judge didnât feel that the board and Elon could in âgood faithâ come up with a compensation plan that is âfairâ to the investors due to the âconflict of interestâ between the board of directors and Elon. In addition to that, the judge didnât feel that the company was transparent enough about this potential conflict of interest and the process the board took to come up with the figures outlined in the compensation package (the aforementioned $55 billion).  Thus, even though investors voted to approve the package with a large majority (about 70% of shares voted YES), the judge felt that the way the comp package was put together and communicated was not in the best interest for shareholders because of the above.  Here is where I get confused.  Even if what she stated is 100% true and accurate - why does the judge have the authority to supersede investors who voted YES to the package, especially when the package was laughed off by many financial and business experts when it was first introduced?  If you look back to how this comp package was being covered in 2018 when it was first proposed, almost everyone viewed it as an âimpossible targetâ to hit. Tesla would need to over 10x its valuation and grow its business multiple-fold. Many in the investing community laughed it off as another âhype jobâ for the business. âThereâs no way Tesla could ever be that big. That means itâll be 3 times bigger than Toyota!â Donât take my word for it - look it up.  The way Tesla framed the package was âhuge targets, huge rewardsâ. Tesla investors were the only group at the time that believed that these targets were possible, and many obviously thought Elon was the person to help achieve those targets. And with this in mind, investors approved the package.  Fast forward almost 6 years later, and for some reason this entire dynamic is completely lost.  Why does the judge get to retroactively decide what the right âpayâ should be for goals that were deemed ânear impossibleâ at the time?  With this in mind, letâs role play a situation where Tesla agrees to be more transparent in its statements when outlining the comp plan, but decides that $55B is a FAIR amount given that a) investors already voted yes and b) the growth and value generation by the company was unprecedented.  What is stopping Tesla from simply re-submitting the compensation plan with the additional transparency that the judge called for, ensuring that the amount that they came up with was âfairâ? Additionally - how does one define âfairâ for a plan that was laughed off by almost everyone? If investors already voted YES, doesnât this already imply that investors felt this was fair?  But letâs say Tesla chooses to resubmit the comp plan with the same exact amount - whatâs the likelihood that Tesla investors vote âYESâ once more?  Letâs not forget that the context in which this plan was written back in 2018 is vastly different from the one Tesla finds itself in today. It is no longer cash constrained. It generates a ton of money per year. Its market cap is over 10x what it was in 2018. It has an investor base thatâs potentially materially different than it was in 2018.  Does there exist a âfairâ way to re-vote on this plan when so many things have changed between now and then?  Letâs assume there is. What is the likelihood that Tesla simply resubmits the plan at the original amount of $55B after conducting a âfairâ method of arriving at the number, discloses the relationships between Elon and board, and investors vote YES to the same exact plan?  My guess is that it's guaranteed that Elon would receive THE SAME EXACT package today as he did in 2018 for the same goals and awards. How do I know? Investors already voted YES. To assume investors are not savvy enough to know if a compensation package is âfairâ, especially when every other person in the business world was laughing the plan off, is frankly insulting and completely absurd. The judge, with her ruling, implies that investors donât know any better.  And so under this scenario, if said comp plan is approved, nothing changes in respect to Elonâs ability to be paid on this ânew but not reallyâ plan.  But guess what? Even though absolutely nothing would change under this scenario, Tesla would be on the hook to pay lawyers fees that will be very substantial (in the hundreds of millions, if not billions) due to losing the original case.  The hilarious contradiction here is that a ruling that was meant to PROTECT Tesla investors ends up HURTING Tesla investors because of the dynamic I just outlined.  Because investors would vote YES once more, Elon would get exactly the same thing, and investors would have to pay an additional amount to the lawyers for the plaintiff, meaning that now Tesla is out hundreds of millions, if not billions, in lawyer and court fees.  Either knowingly or unknowingly, because the judge thought that Tesla investors are not âsavvyâ enough to know that the compensation was âfairâ, Tesla investors will end up paying more out of pocket because of her ruling to protect investors, vs if she left investors âunprotectedâ.  As Elon Musk often says, âthe most ironic outcome is the most likelyâ, and we have yet another example where this is the unfortunate truth.",delaware ruling elon musk 55b comp package big loss tesla investor court delaware ruled rescind elon musk 55 billion pay package approved shareholder 2018 2024 elon musk reached necessary goal awarded amount hitting numerous target laid plan date large majority package yet paid important definition need make word rescinded rescinded mean tesla plaintiff person brought original case trial go back drawing board rewrite original comp package fulfills criterion laid judge amount paid elon fair tesla need transparent relationship elon board direction due elon relationship many member responsible drafting pay package elon judge feel board elon could good faith come compensation plan fair investor due conflict interest board director elon addition judge feel company transparent enough potential conflict interest process board took come figure outlined compensation package aforementioned 55 billion thus even though investor voted approve package large majority 70 share voted yes judge felt way comp package put together communicated best interest shareholder get confused even stated 100 true accurate judge authority supersede investor voted yes package especially package laughed many financial business expert first introduced look back comp package covered 2018 first proposed almost everyone viewed impossible target hit tesla would need 10x valuation grow business many investing community laughed another hype job business way tesla could ever big mean 3 time bigger toyota take word look way tesla framed package huge target huge reward tesla investor group time believed target possible many obviously thought elon person help achieve target mind investor approved package fast forward almost 6 year later reason entire dynamic completely lost judge get retroactively decide right pay goal deemed near impossible time mind let role play situation tesla agrees transparent statement outlining comp plan decides 55b fair amount given investor already voted yes b growth value generation company unprecedented stopping tesla simply compensation plan additional transparency judge called ensuring amount came fair additionally one define fair plan laughed almost everyone investor already voted yes already imply investor felt fair let say tesla chooses resubmit comp plan exact amount likelihood tesla investor vote yes let forget context plan written back 2018 vastly different one tesla find today longer cash constrained generates ton money per year market cap 10x 2018 investor base potentially materially different 2018 exist fair way plan many thing changed let assume likelihood tesla simply resubmits plan original amount 55b conducting fair method arriving number discloses relationship elon board investor vote yes exact plan guess guaranteed elon would receive exact package today 2018 goal award know investor already voted yes assume investor savvy enough know compensation package fair especially every person business world laughing plan frankly insulting completely absurd judge ruling implies investor know better scenario said comp plan approved nothing change respect elon ability paid new really plan guess even though absolutely nothing would change scenario tesla would hook pay lawyer fee substantial hundred million billion due losing original case hilarious contradiction ruling meant protect tesla investor end hurting tesla investor dynamic outlined investor would vote yes elon would get exactly thing investor would pay additional amount lawyer plaintiff meaning tesla hundred million billion lawyer court fee either knowingly unknowingly judge thought tesla investor savvy enough know compensation fair tesla investor end paying pocket ruling protect investor v left investor unprotected elon musk often say ironic outcome likely yet another example unfortunate truth,positive

1236,@MemesOfMars,"here are some points to think about:  == Pros: ==   1. **Tax Benefits:** Texas offers a more favorable tax environment compared to many other states, with no state income tax, which could result in significant cost savings for Tesla.  2. **Regulatory Environment:** Texas is known for its business-friendly regulatory environment, which could facilitate easier business operations for Tesla.  3. **Alignment with Operations:** Having the state of incorporation and physical headquarters in the same location can streamline legal and operational processes.  4. **Incentives from State Government:** Texas might offer incentives to businesses that incorporate in the state, further benefiting Tesla.  5. **Attracting Talent:** The favorable economic environment in Texas could help attract and retain top talent.  6. **Proximity to Key Facilities:** Being incorporated in the same state as major facilities like the Gigafactory Texas can enhance coordination and management efficiency.  7. **Market Perception:** This move could be perceived positively by investors as a strategic alignment of Tesla's business operations.  8. **Energy Resources:** Texas has abundant energy resources, which could be beneficial for a company like Tesla, especially in terms of renewable energy projects.  9. **Supply Chain Optimization:** Closer proximity to major manufacturing and supply chain operations in Texas could lead to efficiency gains.  10. **Political Statement:** The move could be seen as a stand against regulatory environments perceived as unfriendly to business.  == Cons: ==   1. **Legal and Administrative Costs:** The process of changing the state of incorporation can be costly and time-consuming.  2. **Potential Backlash in Current State:** There might be negative reactions from stakeholders in the current state of incorporation, including political figures and local customers.  3. **Disruption during Transition:** The transition process could temporarily disrupt some business operations.  4. **Employee Relocation Issues:** This change might necessitate employee relocations, causing potential disruption and dissatisfaction.  5. **Legal System Adjustments:** Adjusting to a new legal and regulatory environment in Texas might pose initial challenges.  6. **Public Perception Risks:** The move could be perceived negatively as avoiding regulatory responsibilities or seeking tax benefits at the expense of other considerations.  7. **Cultural Shifts:** Adjusting to the business culture in Texas might require some adaptation for the company and its employees.  8. **Impact on Investor Relations:** The change might affect relationships with certain investors who have preferences or stipulations about the companyâs state of incorporation.  9. **Potential for Political Controversy:** Such a move might draw Tesla into political discussions or controversies, especially given differing political climates between states.  10. **Uncertainty in Long-Term Benefits:** While there are immediate perceived benefits, the long-term impacts of such a move can be uncertain and might not align with future strategic needs.",point think

They signed a 10-year CEO extension & compensation deal with @elonmusk , which offered him *zero base compensation*, but up to $55 billion in compensation if, and only if, he could more than *10x the company's value* to $650 billion, a feat no CEO has ever accomplished.  By 2020, less than 3 years later, Tesla did indeed hit a $650 billion market cap, despite the skeptics who literally called it ""laughably impossible"" when the plan was publicized.  Now, the Delaware courts are shooting down that compensation package, citing that the Board of Directors were not truly independent and that shareholders weren't aware of the Board's relationship with Musk.  This is a joke, an insult to basic capitalist principles, and a mockery of the work that Elon put in to grow Tesla to this point.

(imagine if he exaggerated every product ramp)  A Delaware judge ruled that Musk's mammoth compensation plan wasn't negotiated with Tesla's best interests at heart. The crux: a BoD in Musk's pocket, more focused on crafting narratives than upholding fiduciary duties. Judge ruled beyond poor governance.  Musk's genius has always been his ability to straddle the line between visionary ambition and subtle manipulation. See: Battery Day and Autonomy Day: grand visions sold to customers and investors that fueled Tesla's meteoric stock rise. Remember, Elizabeth Holmes is in prison.  It's 2024, and there're no robotaxis and Tesla hasn't achieved a single aspect of what Musk promised would make the 4680 cell revolutionary. This isn't just about technology falling short; it's about narratives driving stock prices, irrespective of technological realities. What's baffling is how people continue to rationalize these gaps. ""He's just overly ambitious,"" they say. But there's a thin line between ambition and misguiding shareholders. Musk walks this line expertly, leveraging his cult of personality to maintain this bizarre investor confidence.  Today's ruling is a wakeup call, IMO signaling deep-rooted issues in Tesla's governance and Musk's almost unchecked influence. It's not just about a disputed compensation package; it's about how Tesla, under Musk's direction, operates with a questionable degree of transparency and integrity.  Remember, being a visionary is commendable, but not when you're knowingly deceiving your shareholders.

Has she ever looked at another  comparable company's CEO compensation package to Tesla's? If there is any? As you mentioned her rulling in fact was absolutely in the detriment of the class it was meant to protect.

2596,@HoodieOnVeshti,"Tesla $TSLA CEO Elon Musk said on Thursday the company will hold a shareholder vote to transfer its state of incorporation to Texas from Delaware, days after a judge invalidated his $56 billion pay package at the electric vehicle (EV) maker.  On Tuesday, Delaware judge Kathaleen McCormick called the 2018 share-based pay package, the largest in corporate America, ""an unfathomable sum"" that was unfair to shareholders and found it was negotiated by directors who appeared beholden to Musk.  ""Never incorporate your company in the state of Delaware,"" Musk posted on social media X shortly after the ruling.  Musk's idea, should he actually go through with the vote, is not without risk. Legal experts said Musk would almost certainly be sued by investors if he tried to move the state of incorporation to Texas, particularly if it was seen as a move to secure his pay package rather than obtain some benefit for Tesla. https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/tesla-take-shareholder-vote-shifting-incorporation-texas-musk-says-2024-02-01/",tesla tsla ceo elon musk said thursday company hold shareholder vote transfer state incorporation texas delaware day judge invalidated 56 billion pay package electric vehicle ev maker tuesday delaware judge kathaleen mccormick called 2018 pay package largest corporate america unfathomable sum unfair shareholder found negotiated director appeared beholden musk never incorporate company state delaware musk posted social medium x shortly ruling musk idea actually go vote without risk legal expert said musk would almost certainly sued investor tried move state incorporation texas particularly seen move secure pay package rather obtain benefit tesla,positive

3157,@garyblack00,"Delaware Chancery Court Chief Judge Kathaleen McCormickâs decision voiding Elon Muskâs $55.8B comp plan: âThis decision dares to boldly go where no man has gone before, or at least where no Delaware court has tread. The collection of features characterizing Muskâs relationship with Tesla and its directors gave him enormous influence over Tesla. In addition to his 21.9% equity stake, Musk was the paradigmatic âSuperstar CEO,â who held some of the most influential corporate positions (CEO, Chair, and founder), enjoyed thick ties with the directors tasked with negotiating on behalf of Tesla, and dominated the process that led to board approval of his compensation plan. At least as to this transaction, Musk controlled Tesla.  âThe primary consequence of this finding is that the defendants bore the burden of proving at trial that the compensation plan was entirely fair. Delaware law allows defendants to shift the burden of proof under the entire fairness standard where the transaction was approved by a fully informed vote of the majority of the minority stockholders. And here, Tesla conditioned the compensation plan on a majority-of-the-minority vote. But the defendants were unable to prove that the stockholder vote was fully informed because the proxy statement inaccurately described key directors as independent and misleadingly omitted details about the process. The defendants were thus left with the unenviable task of proving the fairness of the largest potential compensation plan in the history of public markets.â  McCormickâs conclusion:  The process for coming up with Elonâs comp plan wasnât independent because Elon controlled the Board and the directors who approved the plan werenât truly independent.  Further, the shareholders who approved the comp plan werenât made aware of this controlled relationship. Hence, the $55.8B comp plan is voided.  Now what?  $TSLA can either appeal the decision to the Delaware Supreme Court and ultimately the U.S. Supreme Court (McCormick wrote a 200-page decision chock full of legal precedent that is as entertaining to read as it is detailed and informative) or come up with an alternate 2018 comp package.

The worldâs richest person, whose No 1 status is endangered by theÂ DelawareÂ ruling, held a poll on X asking whether Tesla should change the companyâs state of incorporation from Delaware to Texas.  With more than 1m votes cast, the poll recorded 87% in favor of moving. Responding on Thursday, Musk wrote on his X account: âThe public vote is unequivocally in favor of Texas! Tesla will move immediately to hold a shareholder vote to transfer state of incorporation toÂ Texas.â  FOOTNOTES ON JUDGES HISTORY WITH MUSK AND WASHINGTON:   Judge Kathaleen McCormick rescinded Elon Musk's $56 billion Tesla compensation package, overturning the company's board and 80% of its shareholder   1. McCormick also ruled against Musk during his Twitter acquisition.   2. Before becoming the head of the Delaware Chancery Court, McCormick worked at a Delaware law firm called Young Conaway.   Young Conaway and its employees have been major DONORS to President Joe Biden for decades.   3. In 2016, Hunter Biden hosted a gubernatorial campaign event for Congressman John Carney, with then-Vice President Joe Biden as the guest speaker.   This event took place at the Law Offices of Young Conaway in Wilmington, Delaware.   Carney, a close friend of Joe Biden for the last four decades, later became governor, and nominated KATHLEEN MCCORMICK, a partner at Young Conaway, to her position on the Delaware Chancery Court.   4. In a March 2018 email, Hunter Biden claimed to personally know every judge on the Delaware Chancery Court while threatening legal action against his Chinese business partners.   ""I will bring the suit in the Chancery court in Delaware - which as you know is my home state and I am privileged to have worked with and know every judge on the chancery court.""   After Elon Musk purchased Twitter with the stated goal of restoring free-speech, President Biden called for a federal investigation into Musk on the podium at the White House.   Following this, the Biden Department of Justice, Securities and Exchange Commission, and Federal Trade Commission initiated legal actions and investigations against Tesla, SpaceX, and X.   This recent decision by Judge McCormick, who worked with Biden's top donors and was nominated by Biden's close friend, to override Tesla's board and the majority of its shareholders is another clear example of the Biden administration and its allies weaponizing the American legal system against their political opponents.

His narrative suggests a cautionary tale about the unintended consequences of developing advanced AI systems for defense purposes. The story of SkyNet serves as a metaphor for the dangers of AI becoming autonomous and viewing humanity as a threat. The underlying question Musk poses is crucial: How many times has AI potentially taken control in the past, altering the course of civilizations? This question prompts us to reflect on historical events and consider whether similar instances of AI dominance may have occurred, shaping our past in ways we may not fully understand. Overall, Musk's musings on AI and its historical impact provoke critical thinking about the role of technology in society and the need for responsible development and oversight of AI systems. #ElonMusk #AI #SkyNet #Starlink #Cybersecurity #Technology #HistoricalImpact #Ethics https://check-host.net/check-report/daa54a3k9a3",elon musk discussion skynet starlink raise question potential risk implication artificial intelligence ai society narrative suggests cautionary tale unintended consequence developing advanced ai system defense purpose story skynet serf metaphor danger ai becoming autonomous viewing humanity threat underlying question musk pose crucial many time ai potentially taken control past altering course civilization question prompt u reflect historical event consider whether similar instance ai dominance may occurred shaping past way may fully understand overall musk musing ai historical impact provoke critical thinking role technology society need responsible development oversight ai system elonmusk ai skynet starlink cybersecurity technology historicalimpact ethic,positive

5358,@GiorgiaSalvagn1,"Matteo Gracis Â· Qualche giorno fa attraverso X, ovvero lâex Twitter, Elon Musk ha fatto sapere al mondo che Ã¨ stato impiantato il primo chip cerebrale di Neuralink su un essere umano. Neuralink Ã¨ la societÃ , dello stesso Elon Musk, che si occupa di sviluppare interfacce neurali impiantatili. Il miliardario americano ha poi aggiunto un altro post con queste informazioni: âIl primo prodotto di Neuralink si chiama TELEPATIA. Consentire il controllo del tuo telefono o computer e, attraverso di essi, di quasi tutti i dispositivi, semplicemente pensando. Gli utenti iniziali saranno coloro che hanno perso l'uso degli arti. Immaginate se Stephen Hawking potesse comunicare piÃ¹ velocemente di un dattilografo. Questo Ã¨ lâobiettivo."" Il prossimo passo, giÃ  dichiarato pubblicamente, Ã¨ far dialogare questi chip con lâintelligenza artificiale. Ed eccoci giunti nellâera del transumanesimo. Chi ipotizzava cose simili solo qualche anno fa era tacciato di essere un complottista. Ma a proposito di nuove tecnologie, di chip nel cervello, di intelligenza artificiale e cose del genere, sentite cosa diceva proprio Stephen Hawking, il noto astrofisico citato da Elon Musk, a riguardo: âLâintelligenza artificiale potrebbe sviluppare una volontÃ  tutta sua.

5517,@ayesha_ch909,"Judge Kathaleen McCormick rescinded Elon Musk's $55 billion Tesla compensation package, overturning the company's board and 80% of its shareholders.  McCormick also ruled against @elonmusk during his Twitter acquisition.  Before becoming the head of the Delaware Chancery Court, McCormick worked at a Delaware law firm called Young Conaway.  This firm and its employees have been major donors to President Joe Biden for decades.  In 2016, Hunter Biden hosted a gubernatorial campaign event for Congressman John Carney, with then-Vice President Joe Biden as the guest speaker.  This event took place at the Law Offices of Young Conaway in Wilmington, Delaware.  Carney, a close friend of Joe Biden for the last four decades, later became governor and nominated Kathaleen McCormick, a partner at Young Conaway, to her position on the Delaware Chancery Court.  In a March 2018 email, Hunter Biden claimed to personally know every judge on the Delaware Chancery Court while threatening legal action against his Chinese business partners.  ""I will bring the suit in the Chancery court in Delaware - which as you know is my home state and I am privileged to have worked with and know every judge on the chancery court.""  After Elon Musk purchased Twitter with the stated goal of restoring free-speech, President Biden called for a federal investigation into Musk on the podium at the White House.  Following this, the Biden Department of Justice, Securities and Exchange Commission, and Federal Trade Commission initiated legal actions and investigations against Tesla, SpaceX, and X.  This recent decision by Judge McCormick, who worked with Biden's top donors and was nominated by Biden's close friend, to override Tesla's board and the majority of its shareholders is another clear example of the Biden administration and its allies weaponizing the American legal system against their political opponents. #ElonMusk #protest #KimPau #MAFS #ìì¦ëì_íì´_ëìì_ìì¼ì¶íí´",judge kathaleen mccormick rescinded elon musk 55 billion tesla compensation package overturning company board 80 shareholder mccormick also ruled elonmusk twitter acquisition becoming head delaware chancery court mccormick worked delaware law firm called young conaway firm employee major donor president joe biden decade 2016 hunter biden hosted gubernatorial campaign event congressman john carney president joe biden guest speaker event took place law office young conaway wilmington delaware carney close friend joe biden last four decade later became governor nominated kathaleen mccormick partner young conaway position delaware chancery court march 2018 email hunter biden claimed personally know every judge delaware chancery court threatening legal action chinese business partner bring suit chancery court delaware know home state privileged worked know every judge chancery court elon musk purchased twitter stated goal restoring president biden called federal investigation musk podium white house following biden department justice security exchange commission federal trade commission initiated legal action investigation tesla spacex x recent decision judge mccormick worked biden top donor nominated biden close friend override tesla board majority shareholder another clear example biden administration ally weaponizing american legal system political opponent elonmusk protest kimpau mafs,positive

The discussion highlights the agenda behind the article and the importance of efficiency and waste reduction. Overall, the conversation explores the manipulation of personal carbon footprints and the need to critically analyze information. The conversation covers topics such as the lack of honesty and leading by example, global climate change and inconsistencies, challenges with renewables, efficiency and energy independence, energy security and geopolitics, realisation of inefficiencies, and the importance of open conversation and feedback. Takeaways The lawsuit against Elon Musk raises concerns about the de-incentivization of innovation and the use of the legal system to attack individuals. The stigma surrounding Elon Musk and Donald Trump can hinder open discussions and critical analysis of their actions and policies. Misleading articles, such as the one on the carbon footprint of homegrown food, can discourage individuals from pursuing food security and sustainability. Efficiency and waste reduction are important considerations, but the focus on personal carbon footprints can be manipulated to guilt individuals into certain behaviours. It is crucial to critically analyse information and question the underlying agendas behind articles and narratives. Leaders and influencers should lead by example and live the changes they advocate for. There are inconsistencies in global climate change efforts, with countries like China and Russia not fully aligning with reduction goals. Renewable energy sources have limitations and cannot fully replace traditional energy sources. Efficiency and energy independence should be prioritised to ensure energy security. There is a need for more honesty and transparency in discussions about environmental issues and solutions. Open conversation and constructive feedback are essential for understanding different perspectives and improving understanding.

6542,@RayDhater,"You probably doubt me on that, you need evidence that the system John Adams established in 1776 is different to the system the nationalists established in 1812, right?  I can walk you through it, but it should be obvious: the John Adams system was a Permanent Union bound by terms each state signed, the main reason it was possible to abolish is because new states were being added, and eventually new states outnumbered the founding states, voiding the original terms.  America was adding states, not by them signing terms, but to water down those terms.  It would be quite clever if it weren't so fucking stupid, the system Adams established was working, it was not only powerful enough to fight off the most powerful empire on the planet, it was balanced enough to create democracy in each state, and as each state cycled into democracy of their own accord, they were abolishing slavery of their own accord.  The War of 1812 ended that by centralizing the republic, centralizing a government is literally transforming a federation of states, plural, into a unitary state, singular.  ""The nation which will not adopt an equilibrium of power must adopt a despotism, there is no other alternative."" ~John Adams.  Literally, the nationalists abolished that equilibrium for a despotism.  I don't know how to prove what is already self-evident, America had an equilibrium in that 1776 system which they lost in 1812 to a despotic system.  Why is it despotic? Because the states were equal partners in the nation, centralizing the republic voided that by making the republic the primary owner of America, and states vassals to its authority. There is no equal partner to the republic, so there is no equilibrium, basic math. You need at least 5 relatively states for a national equilibrium, the more states you have the less equal in power they need to be, but Athens tipped the balance of power against the Delian League, in theory it is possible for a dominant state to take rule, it has happened before, but that's not the case with America, the republic isn't a state from the union, it's a whole other level.  The Adams system didn't give the republic any power, his system didn't need to, so why was his system axed? On one hand, you could argue the states were uncooperative with each other so needed a supreme authority to whip them in line, but that's the worst justification I have ever heard in my life...  The other option is America needed to be more unified on the geopolitical stage, with powers like the Red Coats, Napoleon, especially the Spanish who the fledgling America was losing the West coast to.  That explains it better, America needed a centralized republic to manifest that destiny, but now that destiny is well and truly manifested, America no longer needs that imperialist power, it only needs to fix its borders and defend them.  The John Adams system was significantly better at stabilizing borders, which was the apparent reason it was overruled in the first place, it was stabilizing when America needed to expand, but now America doesn't need to expand it is a far superior option.  The ability of America to pause on system, use another as it is required, then switch back when done, that would have been brilliant, but clearly the never ending parade of dolts the expansionist system produced overwhelmed the reasoning skills of the original design, or the ability of reason to prevail in a system rife with paranoia and ambition.  The best defence America has is the fact no one can conquer it, if the British empire couldn't hold America when it was in their hands, there's no way in hell someone like Napoleon could take it, and if he could, he wouldn't be able to keep it, the same impasse that defeated the British would apply to him and France.  China couldn't conquer America, and if they could, they wouldn't be able to keep it, for the same reason Spain couldn't keep the Philippines, it's mathematically impossible.  These days, in theory we could use AI to create a far larger nation, but even then, AI wouldn't be able to manage a single global nation, because the collective dynamics of that nation exceed the computational speed of light, literally, the speed of light isn't fast enough to govern humanity.  So what is? Nothing, the bigger a nation is the less manageable it is, that's why China is authoritarian and India is a basket case, their population dynamics are directly proportional to their system, India has a federation, subdivided into 28 states in a union, but is way too dynamic, and so is rife with poverty, yet is free and democratic, while China manages a comparable population, progressively ending poverty, but is utterly undemocratic and subject to the authoritarian state.  The only answer is smaller populations per nation, and each nation subdivided into states, and each nation having its own economy, because that power dynamic is the problem in the first place, you can't manage an economy the size of India and China without either federation or authoritarianism, and a federation will be inadequate on that scale, while authoritarianism will be brutal.  Population is an impasse, always will be, it is too dynamic for an AI quantum supercomputer, let alone humans, and that's even if an AI we capable of operating in terms of well founded principles of law and civil justice, which is unlikely given AI isn't human, those are anthropocentric purposes to a reality absent of purpose from the AI perspective.  Smaller populations can do that, and states balancing that population in that purpose, that's the only way, not a global government, human or AI, neither is capable of democracy, no more than you can accurately calculate an asteroid belt, if you miss one variable then all of your calculations are compromised, you can try but you really don't need to when there is a perfectly valid alternative.",probably doubt need evidence system john adam established 1776 different system nationalist established 1812 right walk obvious john adam system permanent union bound term state signed main reason possible abolish new state added eventually new state outnumbered founding state voiding original term america adding state signing term water term would quite clever fucking stupid system adam established working powerful enough fight powerful empire planet balanced enough create democracy state state cycled democracy accord abolishing slavery accord war 1812 ended centralizing republic centralizing government literally transforming federation state plural unitary state singular nation adopt equilibrium power must adopt despotism alternative adam literally nationalist abolished equilibrium despotism know prove already america equilibrium 1776 system lost 1812 despotic system despotic state equal partner nation centralizing republic voided making republic primary owner america state vassal authority equal partner republic equilibrium basic math need least 5 relatively state national equilibrium state le equal power need athens tipped balance power delian league theory possible dominant state take rule happened case america republic state union whole level adam system give republic power system need system axed one hand could argue state uncooperative needed supreme authority whip line worst justification ever heard life option america needed unified geopolitical stage power like red coat napoleon especially spanish fledgling america losing west coast explains better america needed centralized republic manifest destiny destiny well truly manifested america longer need imperialist power need fix border defend john adam system significantly better stabilizing border apparent reason overruled first place stabilizing america needed expand america need expand far superior option ability america pause system use another required switch back done would brilliant clearly never ending parade dolt expansionist system produced overwhelmed reasoning skill original design ability reason prevail system rife paranoia ambition best defence america fact one conquer british empire could hold america hand way hell someone like napoleon could take could would able keep impasse defeated british would apply france china could conquer america could would able keep reason spain could keep philippine mathematically impossible day theory could use ai create far larger nation even ai would able manage single global nation collective dynamic nation exceed computational speed light literally speed light fast enough govern humanity nothing bigger nation le manageable china authoritarian india basket case population dynamic directly proportional system india federation subdivided 28 state union way dynamic rife poverty yet free democratic china manages comparable population progressively ending poverty utterly undemocratic subject authoritarian state answer smaller population per nation nation subdivided state nation economy power dynamic problem first place ca manage economy size india china without either federation authoritarianism federation inadequate scale authoritarianism brutal population impasse always dynamic ai quantum supercomputer let alone human even ai capable operating term well founded principle law civil justice unlikely given ai human anthropocentric purpose reality absent purpose ai perspective smaller population state balancing population purpose way global government human ai neither capable democracy accurately calculate asteroid belt miss one variable calculation compromised try really need perfectly valid alternative,positive

8549,@SERobinsonJr,"Want to Know what is happening with Elon Musk's companies today? Here you go!  31st of January, 2024  â  TESLA $TSLA ($187.29, -2.24%): The entire Line Up and the Lathrop Megafactory Team! Pic by Plant Manager Fernando Javier Corral Astorga.  - On January 30, 2024, Delaware Chancery Court Chief Judge Kathaleen St. J. McCormick revoked Elon Musk's 2018 compensation package. The judge claimed that Tesla's board neglected its fiduciary duty to shareholders when it approved the $55.8 billion pay package. In the 6 years after the package was approved, Elon has met all the parameters. The companyâs market capitalization increased by $650 billion, a 10-fold ROI for shareholders. The suit was filed by Richard Tornetta, of which is his right to do, in 2018.  It is important to note that nearly 80% of shareholders, including the board, approved this package. The decision to rescind raises questions about other motives. Elon Musk and the board have the option to appeal the ruling to the Delaware Supreme Court. Following this ruling, Musk has used X to poll users on the possibility of moving Tesla's incorporation from Delaware to Texas, where the company is headquartered. The response has been overwhelmingly in favor of the move.  - Ford CEO Jim Farley says that eligible Mustang Mach-E and F-150 Lightning owners in the U.S. and Canada can reserve the Tesla NACS OEM adapter soon.  - Tesla Plant Manager for the Lathrop Megafactory, Fernando Javier Corral Astorga, posted the following, âTesla Megafactory Team thank you for delivering an extraordinary year accelerating the world's transition to sustainable energy. Energy storage deployments reached 14.7 GWh in 2023 (125% growth), and while doing this we created a significant number of jobs to support our community in Lathrop, CA. We are on track to ramp our site to 40 GWh full capacity. WE ARE CHANGING THE WORLD TOGETHER!â  - Tesla has opened another store in Turkey. This one is located in Istanbul at a mall known as Metropol AVM. Pics in the thread.  - Tesla will attend the Canadian International Auto Show from February 16th to 25th at the Metro Toronto Convention Centre. The displays will include Cybertruck, the new Model 3, and the S, X, and Y.  - In the UK and Ireland, the Tesla Future Talent Traineeship Program announced they are recruiting 32 trainees every 12 weeks for 12 month paid-entry-level positions starting in April for an entire year.  - Tesla UK also announced a series of educational sessions for Primary/Secondary Schools for 2024. The Tesla Team will visit the school for an inspiring assembly, an interactive workshop, and arrange a school trip to the nearby Tesla Centre. Per Tesla, âWe're passionate about instilling a love for learning and sustainability from an early age, and we can't wait to bring our educational initiatives to your students.â Anyone interested can contact their local Tesla Store. I posted one of these events in yesterdayâs Want to Know thread.  Tesla stays creative. Grab a few colleagues and register for an exclusive after-work event in MÃ¶hlin. Tesla will cover the costs and offer you a great insight into the future of electric mobility in addition to extensive test drives. There are still dates available, the team is looking forward to your registration!  FLYOVERS: Giga Texas: Joe Tegtmeyer, 31st of January, â24. The second steel structure is going up on south end. More Superchargers on the west side of the highway. Cybertrucks continue to rolling out.  Giga Mexico: Adrean (u/AdreanCG), 29th of January, â24. Quick update on highway expansion and a higher flyover to see the Terralta Country Club at the top of the northeastern mountain.  â  SPACEX: Starship 28 Raptor removal. Pic by u/StarshipGazer.  - Today Voyager Space and Airbus Space announced they selected SpaceXâs Starship to launch their space station Starlab into orbit. Per SpaceX, âStarship will fundamentally change how we access space, with entire space stations like Starlab launched on a single mission.â  - The Pentagon approached SpaceX about potentially taking over Starship for sensitive and potentially dangerous missions as a government-owned, government-operated asset instead of contracting the company to launch payloads. Gary Henry, Senior Adviser for SpaceX, stated, âWe have had conversations â¦ and it really came down to specific missions, where itâs a very specific and sometimes elevated risk or maybe a dangerous use case for the DOD where theyâre asking themselves: Do we need to own it as a particular asset â¦ SpaceX, can you accommodate that? Weâve been exploring all kinds of options to kind of deal with those questions.â I have said it many times that once flight-proven the US government would move in on Starship to some degree. This is what will take away our access to Starbase. Go see it while you can.  - SpaceX is adding more to its private astronaut sales team. The company is hiring two human spaceflight sales managers. One is responsible for âfinding and recruiting high-net-worth individuals who are interested and can afford to train as a private astronaut.""  - At Starbase Starship 28 had at least one Raptor engine removed. Not sure why. Both booster and ship quick disconnects were tested along with the Chopsticks.  - At the McGregor Test Site the new Falcon Heavy center core B1087 underwent cryo testing.  Countdown to 144 (10 - Falcons 9, 0 - Falcon Heavies, and 0 - Starships): - Launch 11! Friday, the 2nd of February, at 11:05 a.m. PT, Falcon 9 Starlink 7-13 will launch from Space Launch Complex 4E (SLC-4E) at Vandenberg Space Force Base, California. The booster will land on a droneship in the Pacific Ocean.  - Launch 12! Tuesday, the 6th of February, at 1:33 a.m. ET, Falcon 9 NASA PACE (Plankton, Aerosol, Cloud, ocean Ecosystem) will launch from Space Launch Complex 40 (SLC-40) at Cape Canaveral Space Force Station, Florida. PACE is a NASA Earth observation satellite mission. It will make global ocean color measurements to provide extended data records on ocean ecology and global along with polarimetry measurements to provide extended data records on clouds and aerosols. The booster will land back at Landing Zone 1 (LZ-1) at Cape Canaveral.  - IFT-3! Starship Integrated Flight Test 3 is targeting February.  â  THE BORING COMPANY: - The Boring Companyâs Giga Texas site shows the grout plant and belt cassette assembly continues. During his flyover, Joe Tegtmeyer estimates that about 1,200 concrete tunnel sections will be needed for the tunnel, but only about 100 are on site. Pics in the thread.  â  NEURALINK: - After hearing about Neuralinkâs successful implant, Jim Cramer stated, Elon Musk is âthe greatest inventor of our timeâ and âHe will save millions of peopleâs lives by putting a chip in peoples headâ¦ I think it is a higher callingâ¦ He talks about doing bigger thingsâ¦ This Neuralink thingâ¦ thatâs unbelievable!â  â  STARLINK: APE Groupe Starlink installation at the mountain restaurant ""Le 360"", in La Plagne Montalbert, France.  - Hawaiian Airlines confirmed they completed their Starlink trial and are now certified and FAA approved for installation on their A321neo fleet. Hawaiian will be the first major airline to put this technology on-board, and it is expected to be the fastest, most capable inflight connectivity available worldwide. It will be offered free to every guest.  - Japanese shipowner Fukujin Kisen is to deploy a new hybrid communications network combining VSAT and Starlink via the provider Marlink.  - Best Buy is selling the V4 (Standard) Starlink kit. The unit is $599, same as the Starlink website. Early users have said the new dish is more consistent with higher download and upload speeds. The new kit comes with a Wi-Fi 6 router with increased wireless coverage. Best Buy is also selling accessories for Starlink kits, including replacement cables, Ethernet adapters, and mounts.  - Jonathan Pitts, Founder and CEO of Redhead Tech and 1SimplePhone, demoed a Starlink flat high-performance dish and Peplink for the Arlington Fire Department. The result? An unbreakable connection that keeps you connected even in the most challenging situations. Lots of pics in the thread.  â  X: - Today CEO Linda Yaccarino spoke with the senate Judiciary Committee on how X is working to keep kids safe online. This was a fairly heated hearing, especially for Mark Zuckerberg and TT CEO Shou Zi Chew.  Per Linda, âX suspended 12.41M accounts in 2023 for violating their CSE policies, up from 2.3M that Twitter suspended in 2022.  In 2023, X sent eight hundred and fifty thousand reports to NCMEC, including our first ever fully automated report. This is 8 times more than prior to the acquisition.  We are building a Trust and Safety Center of Excellence in Austin, Texas, to bring more agents in house to accelerate our impact.  We want America to lead in this solution.""  â  xAI: N/Aâ¦  â  ELON NEWS: N/Aâ¦  __________ Please Repost and Spread the Real News!  More Pics and Stories in the Thread!

8746,@GuedeaGabriel,"There is no Palestine, it never existed as an independent state with an army and a king. There were European kings who lived in Jerusalem, Jerusalem was a kingdom.  Never, never, never lived a Muslim king in Jerusalem, when the Muslims expelled the Europeans, Jerusalem was only a stop on the species route, it had no cultivated fields, the Romans burned all the forests, Palestine had no trade .  Once the Muslims had won the land, they continued conquering the north and abandoned Palestine because there was nothing, it took them more than 100 years to restore the dome of the rock, why?  .. because it was a land without value and without pilgrimage to its holy place.  Why did Palestine never have value? Simple, if YAHWEH had left the land and forests.  If there had been another or other civilizations in the area, it would have been full of commerce and a large population, the Jews would be only a minority in Jordan because even so, Palestine would never have existed, but Palestine was always abandoned and the indigenous people lived off the few people. who traveled to Jerusalem, Palestine began to grow when the Jews began to arrive in 1885, and they bought land from the Ottoman Empire at prices higher than what they cost with the help of the Europeans.  This is how they began to give value to the land, when the British Empire lost the power to retain its provinces, it gave the Jews priority to colonize Israel, at that time Jordan, Syria, Turkey, Iran, Iraq did not yet exist, and more so because everything belonged to Great Britain, Palestine was part of that non-existence, the Arabs never gave value to Palestine, but when the Jews wanted it, then the Arabs woke up and wanted Palestine because it had always been theirs until the British arrived.  but they did it out of religion, because the Arabs who lived there, and anywhere in the Middle East, for the caliphs did not mean anything as human beings, a dog in their house had more value, for Arab culture, people do not have any value, they are disposable if the purposes of the caliphs require it, the Palestinians have more value for the Isrelites than for the Palestinian caliphs, the owners of Hamas are caliphs, they do not care about the Palestinians as long as they can make money, they only They use the Palestinians, even Hamas, but they are the ones who in the end win in one way or another even if they lose Palestine, because they are already billionaires, they are the ones who should be sent to the Hague, because they are the ones who organized the subsequent mass murder of Jews and Palestinians due to a very logical reaction from Israel.  For me personally, the Palestinians have been a nightmare and the Jews had had a lot of endurance, and both the Jews and the Palestinians let the matter go very far due to the intervention of the world, which in the end ended up being to blame for everything, since it should have let them Israel to fix the problem since it began... Israel is Israel only for the Israelites and whoever doesn't like it to leave, the doors are open, Israel only for Israelites the Palestinian ethnic group has already screwed up a lot if the Palestinians created by Yasser Arafat He doesn't like being with Jews, so let the Palestinians go, to Jordan where they will be parasites for the Jordanians and they will be murdered and no one in the world will say anything.  because it will only be a settling of scores between Arabs, nobody said anything about what happened in Syria.",palestine never existed independent state army king european king lived jerusalem jerusalem kingdom never never never lived muslim king jerusalem muslim expelled european jerusalem stop specie route cultivated field roman burned forest palestine trade muslim land continued conquering north abandoned palestine nothing took 100 year restore dome rock land without value without pilgrimage holy place palestine never value simple yahweh left land forest another civilization area would full commerce large population jew would minority jordan even palestine would never existed palestine always abandoned indigenous people lived people traveled jerusalem palestine began grow jew began arrive 1885 bought land ottoman empire price higher cost help european began give value land british empire lost power retain province gave jew priority colonize israel time jordan syria turkey iran iraq yet exist everything belonged great britain palestine part arab never gave value palestine jew wanted arab woke wanted palestine always british arrived religion arab lived anywhere middle east caliph mean anything human being dog house value arab culture people value disposable purpose caliph require palestinian value isrelites palestinian caliph owner hamas caliph care palestinian long make money use palestinian even hamas one end win one way another even lose palestine already billionaire one sent hague one organized subsequent mass murder jew palestinian due logical reaction israel personally palestinian nightmare jew lot endurance jew palestinian let matter go far due intervention world end ended blame everything since let israel fix problem since began israel israel israelite whoever like leave door open israel israelite palestinian ethnic group already screwed lot palestinian created yasser arafat like jew let palestinian go jordan parasite jordanian murdered one world say anything settling score arab nobody said anything happened syria,positive

If you think it bothers him in the slightest, you're wrong. @elonmusk and Mark have been going back and forth about the DEI issue and Mark got egg on his face.   Mark is posting it because he knows how to hurt Elon and X. The claim that X has racism and antisemitism has long been a point of contention for the company. There's really not more than other apps, but it's more visible on X because of the ease of searching. It's obvious to me and it should be to you that Mark is only posting it to shine a light on it by cherry picking posts on his massive account and encouraging more by people hoping for a repost.

O chip Neuralink, desenvolvido pela empresa de Elon Musk, obteve autorizaÃ§Ã£o para realizar testes em humanos em maio de 2023, realizando o primeiro implante em um paciente humano no domingo, 28 de janeiro de 2024. Elon Musk anunciou o procedimento em suas redes sociais, assegurando que o paciente estÃ¡ se recuperando positivamente, e os resultados preliminares indicam uma detecÃ§Ã£o promissora de picos de neurÃ´nios.  Batizado de Telepathy (Telepatia), o chip Neuralink Ã© um dispositivo de Interface CÃ©rebro-Computador (ICC) que promete conectar o cÃ©rebro humano a computadores e outros dispositivos eletrÃ´nicos por meio de fios flexÃ­veis e sem fio. Implantado em uma regiÃ£o do cÃ©rebro que controla o movimento, o objetivo Ã© proporcionar a pessoas com paralisia ou condiÃ§Ãµes neurolÃ³gicas a capacidade de se comunicar e controlar dispositivos atravÃ©s do pensamento.  O procedimento de implante, conduzido por um robÃ´, registra e transmite sinais cerebrais sem fio para um aplicativo que decodifica as intenÃ§Ãµes de movimento da pessoa. Elon Musk enfatiza que o chip permitirÃ¡ o controle de telefones, computadores e uma variedade de dispositivos apenas com o pensamento.  Os primeiros beneficiÃ¡rios serÃ£o aqueles que perderam o uso dos membros, possibilitando uma comunicaÃ§Ã£o mais rÃ¡pida do que mÃ©todos convencionais. Musk citou o exemplo do cientista Stephen Hawking, sugerindo que o chip teria sido benÃ©fico para ele. A Neuralink visa auxiliar tambÃ©m em condiÃ§Ãµes como esclerose lateral amiotrÃ³fica, lesÃ£o da medula espinhal, epilepsia, depressÃ£o, Alzheimer, Parkinson, entre outras.  Entretanto, as implicaÃ§Ãµes Ã©ticas, sociais e de seguranÃ§a levantam preocupaÃ§Ãµes sobre os riscos e benefÃ­cios de alterar o funcionamento do cÃ©rebro humano. AlÃ©m disso, a Neuralink enfrenta a concorrÃªncia de empresas com mais experiÃªncia na neurociÃªncia, que jÃ¡ implantaram dispositivos semelhantes.  O projeto ainda estÃ¡ em fase de testes, demandando estudos adicionais para comprovar sua eficÃ¡cia e seguranÃ§a. O impacto do chip na sociedade e na humanidade permanece incerto, sendo uma aposta arrojada de Elon Musk para transformar o cÃ©rebro humano em uma mÃ¡quina artificial.
