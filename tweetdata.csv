16,@KanekoaTheGreat,"Judge Kathaleen McCormick rescinded Elon Musk's $55 billion Tesla compensation package, overturning the company's board and 80% of its shareholders.  McCormick also ruled against @elonmusk during his Twitter acquisition.  Before becoming the head of the Delaware Chancery Court, McCormick worked at a Delaware law firm called Young Conaway.  This firm and its employees have been major donors to President Joe Biden for decades.  In 2016, Hunter Biden hosted a gubernatorial campaign event for Congressman John Carney, with then-Vice President Joe Biden as the guest speaker.  This event took place at the Law Offices of Young Conaway in Wilmington, Delaware.  Carney, a close friend of Joe Biden for the last four decades, later became governor and nominated Kathaleen McCormick, a partner at Young Conaway, to her position on the Delaware Chancery Court.  In a March 2018 email, Hunter Biden claimed to personally know every judge on the Delaware Chancery Court while threatening legal action against his Chinese business partners.  ""I will bring the suit in the Chancery court in Delaware - which as you know is my home state and I am privileged to have worked with and know every judge on the chancery court.""  After Elon Musk purchased Twitter with the stated goal of restoring free-speech, President Biden called for a federal investigation into Musk on the podium at the White House.  Following this, the Biden Department of Justice, Securities and Exchange Commission, and Federal Trade Commission initiated legal actions and investigations against Tesla, SpaceX, and X.  This recent decision by Judge McCormick, who worked with Biden's top donors and was nominated by Biden's close friend, to override Tesla's board and the majority of its shareholders is another clear example of the Biden administration and its allies weaponizing the American legal system against their political opponents."
17,@ps5_expert_play,You seem to think long term shareholder's have no right to disagree with the judge's assessment.   Just because a judge decided that something was material does not mean shareholder's have to agree with that opinion.

25,@FredericLambert,"I'm getting tired of talking about this. You are probably too, but it's important. I feel like @elonmusk is proving the judge's point with his reaction to the decision.  Instead of addressing any of the governance concerns highlighted in the decision, he misleadingly frames the whole thing as being about ""taking away shareholders' right to decide for themselves"" when in fact, all her decision is doing is forcing a new shareholder vote with an updated comp package crafted while following the rules of a public company and presented to shareholders in a more transparent way.  Who would not want that? I know it's frustrating for Elon as it was his performance compensation and he delivered on the performance, but I don't see a way he is not made whole in this. He needs to try to see both sides.  But now Elon is instead misleading shareholders about the nature of the whole situation and moving the company's incorporation to Texas? it's kind of her point in the decision."

419,@charliekirk11,"A federal judge has thrown out Elon Musk’s pay package as CEO of Tesla, on the grounds that Musk made so much money it was “unfair.” Instead, the judge says that Musk should have worked for free the past five years.  Elon Musk has increased the value of Tesla by more than ten times since he entered into the pay package. He is by a country mile the most successful CEO in America, and it’s impossible to imagine Tesla succeeding as it has without Musk helming it. Tesla shareholders, even when Musk and his brother were excluded, easily approved the pay package.  It’s increasingly obvious that the US court system only exists to attack political enemies under the guise of the law.  https://www.cnn.com/2024/01/30/investing/elon-musk-pay-package-thrown-out/index.html"
420,@farzyness,"Delaware's ruling on Elon Musk's $55B comp package is a big loss for Tesla investors.  A court in Delaware has ruled to rescind Elon Musk’s $55 BILLION pay package that was approved by shareholders in 2018. As of 2024, Elon Musk has reached the necessary goals to be awarded the amount by hitting numerous targets laid out by the plan. As of this date, a very large majority of the package has yet to be paid out..  An important definition that we need to make is on the word “rescinded”. Rescinded means that Tesla and the plaintiff (the person who brought the original case to trial) have to go back to the drawing board and “rewrite” the original comp package so that it fulfills the below criteria laid out by the judge:  - The amount paid to Elon is “fair”. - Tesla needs to be more transparent about the relationship between Elon and the Board of Directions, due to Elon having long-time relationships with many of the members that were responsible for drafting the pay package for Elon.  The judge didn’t feel that the board and Elon could in “good faith” come up with a compensation plan that is “fair” to the investors due to the “conflict of interest” between the board of directors and Elon. In addition to that, the judge didn’t feel that the company was transparent enough about this potential conflict of interest and the process the board took to come up with the figures outlined in the compensation package (the aforementioned $55 billion).  Thus, even though investors voted to approve the package with a large majority (about 70% of shares voted YES), the judge felt that the way the comp package was put together and communicated was not in the best interest for shareholders because of the above.  Here is where I get confused.  Even if what she stated is 100% true and accurate - why does the judge have the authority to supersede investors who voted YES to the package, especially when the package was laughed off by many financial and business experts when it was first introduced?  If you look back to how this comp package was being covered in 2018 when it was first proposed, almost everyone viewed it as an “impossible target” to hit. Tesla would need to over 10x its valuation and grow its business multiple-fold. Many in the investing community laughed it off as another “hype job” for the business. “There’s no way Tesla could ever be that big. That means it’ll be 3 times bigger than Toyota!” Don’t take my word for it - look it up.  The way Tesla framed the package was “huge targets, huge rewards”. Tesla investors were the only group at the time that believed that these targets were possible, and many obviously thought Elon was the person to help achieve those targets. And with this in mind, investors approved the package.  Fast forward almost 6 years later, and for some reason this entire dynamic is completely lost.  Why does the judge get to retroactively decide what the right “pay” should be for goals that were deemed “near impossible” at the time?  With this in mind, let’s role play a situation where Tesla agrees to be more transparent in its statements when outlining the comp plan, but decides that $55B is a FAIR amount given that a) investors already voted yes and b) the growth and value generation by the company was unprecedented.  What is stopping Tesla from simply re-submitting the compensation plan with the additional transparency that the judge called for, ensuring that the amount that they came up with was “fair”? Additionally - how does one define “fair” for a plan that was laughed off by almost everyone? If investors already voted YES, doesn’t this already imply that investors felt this was fair?  But let’s say Tesla chooses to resubmit the comp plan with the same exact amount - what’s the likelihood that Tesla investors vote “YES” once more?  Let’s not forget that the context in which this plan was written back in 2018 is vastly different from the one Tesla finds itself in today. It is no longer cash constrained. It generates a ton of money per year. Its market cap is over 10x what it was in 2018. It has an investor base that’s potentially materially different than it was in 2018.  Does there exist a “fair” way to re-vote on this plan when so many things have changed between now and then?  Let’s assume there is. What is the likelihood that Tesla simply resubmits the plan at the original amount of $55B after conducting a “fair” method of arriving at the number, discloses the relationships between Elon and board, and investors vote YES to the same exact plan?  My guess is that it's guaranteed that Elon would receive THE SAME EXACT package today as he did in 2018 for the same goals and awards. How do I know? Investors already voted YES. To assume investors are not savvy enough to know if a compensation package is “fair”, especially when every other person in the business world was laughing the plan off, is frankly insulting and completely absurd. The judge, with her ruling, implies that investors don’t know any better.  And so under this scenario, if said comp plan is approved, nothing changes in respect to Elon’s ability to be paid on this “new but not really” plan.  But guess what? Even though absolutely nothing would change under this scenario, Tesla would be on the hook to pay lawyers fees that will be very substantial (in the hundreds of millions, if not billions) due to losing the original case.  The hilarious contradiction here is that a ruling that was meant to PROTECT Tesla investors ends up HURTING Tesla investors because of the dynamic I just outlined.  Because investors would vote YES once more, Elon would get exactly the same thing, and investors would have to pay an additional amount to the lawyers for the plaintiff, meaning that now Tesla is out hundreds of millions, if not billions, in lawyer and court fees.  Either knowingly or unknowingly, because the judge thought that Tesla investors are not “savvy” enough to know that the compensation was “fair”, Tesla investors will end up paying more out of pocket because of her ruling to protect investors, vs if she left investors “unprotected”.  As Elon Musk often says, “the most ironic outcome is the most likely”, and we have yet another example where this is the unfortunate truth."

The paper added that “the most viewed and liked posts…showed support for the Pizzagate conspiracy and came from verified accounts.”  Meanwhile, Mark Zuckerberg’s Instagram and Facebook enable child sex trafficking while simultaneously silencing anyone exposing Pizzagate.

January 2018: Tesla announces a 10-year compensation package for Elon Musk, which was primarily focused on Tesla's market capitalization and operational milestones. This package was seen as ""ambitious"" and designed to aggressively align Musk's financial incentives with the long-term success of Tesla and its shareholders.  March 2018: The compensation package was approved by Tesla's shareholders.   Tesla Achieving Milestones: Musk earned all 12 tranches of stock option awards as Tesla met the escalating financial and operational goals.  January 2024: A Delaware judge, Chancellor Kathaleen St. Jude McCormick, ruled that the compensation package, potentially worth more than $55 billion, was ""unfathomable"" and invalidates it.

Without the incentives, he could have easily stepped down as CEO and then where would have @Tesla been? Admittedly, I was skeptical he’d hit the most ambitious targets of the package. But he did — having put his entire comp at risk. Isn’t that what we want when we say “pay for performance?”"

923,@kerrikgray,"I think the point is not about the money, it’s about the fact that she literally overturned the vote of the majority of stockholders.   The agreed upon targets were met and so the package was exercised.    Also, he’s not the only one that benefited from Tesla stock increases, all shareholders benefited."
924,@DrInsensitive,"The first woman to head the Delaware Chancery Court just found a way to remove 25% of Elon Musk's wealth, and reduce his stake in Tesla from 20% to 13%.  From 2018 to 2022, Musk took zero salary for running Tesla, and was compensated only through stock options received if he met 12 performance goals.  He met the goals, and Tesla shareholders saw their share value increase from $50B to $600B. Musk transformed Tesla from a struggling electric car maker to a leviathan worth more than all other American car makers combined.   He got less than 10% of that windfall.  Now that Tesla shareholders have collected the payoff from his work, Judge Kathaleen McCormick says they don't have to honor the pay deal.   Most large companies incorporate in Delaware, specifically for the Delaware Chancery Court. Look for that to change now.  Judge McCormick began her career at the Legal Aid Society, which helps low-income people navigate the court system."

1118,@Joscocok,"This is an insult to the judge’s professionalism.   According to the judge, the defendant didn’t make the case that the compensation was not excessive. Perhaps Elon needs a better legal team.   This should have been an easy case to win for Elon, as it was all performance-based: high risk/high reward.   There is no debate that Elon is the Board. The only two question here are whether the awards are well-deserved and under what circumstances a judge can overturn the award.   I’m no corporate or M&A lawyer. I will leave that debate to the professionals.   Elon will get paid. The Board will take care of him. I think it’s likely that he gets a lower comp for services rendered, if he doesn’t win the appeal (highly unlikely), and gets a bigger incentive-based performance package going forward that will more than make up for what might be lost."

1332,@PTrubey,"You are failing to realize there is a very real danger of a biased Delaware judicial system that will continue to render non-favorable rulings against Tesla. The judge’s decision was her opinion, with the rule of law behind it, but still only an opinion. Another judge could likely have ruled the other way as this judge even admitted in her own written opinion.   The same lawyer who brought this case also just said on Bloomberg TV that he will sue Tesla again should a similar pay package be adopted by shareholders again. So Tesla is prudently not subjecting itself to the same judge. Not reincorporating would be the bad decision."

Why don’t you support @NikkiHaley with your tweets instead of pushing more Republican, BS.  I am upset about the border, but unless they work together, nothing is getting done.   Romney said Trump does not want the border fixed and has communicated that with Republicans.  None of this is OK.   I guess you only gave !, so you weren’t necessarily taking sides, but you are sharing with over 100 million people and emotional and unofficial document (from a legal perspective).   This document is a memo. And it leaves out all accountability for the Republican side.  I never thought we would have a worse speaker than Mitch McConnell. We have found far worse with speaker Johnson.   Tagging for fairness: @POTUS @GOP @DNC.  All these absurdities simply make me want to vote only for Biden or Nikki.   Your tweet sealed the deal.

1515,@WhiteHat2001,"@elonmusk   Judge Kathaleen McCormick rescinded Elon Musk's $55 billion Tesla compensation package, overturning the company's board and 80% of its shareholders.  McCormick also ruled against @elonmusk during his Twitter acquisition.  Before becoming the head of the Delaware Chancery Court, McCormick worked at a Delaware law firm called Young Conaway.  This firm and its employees have been major donors to President Joe Biden for decades.  In 2016, Hunter Biden hosted a gubernatorial campaign event for Congressman John Carney, with then-Vice President Joe Biden as the guest speaker.  This event took place at the Law Offices of Young Conaway in Wilmington, Delaware.  Carney, a close friend of Joe Biden for the last four decades, later became governor and nominated Kathaleen McCormick, a partner at Young Conaway, to her position on the Delaware Chancery Court.  In a March 2018 email, Hunter Biden claimed to personally know every judge on the Delaware Chancery Court while threatening legal action against his Chinese business partners.  ""I will bring the suit in the Chancery court in Delaware - which as you know is my home state and I am privileged to have worked with and know every judge on the chancery court.""  After Elon Musk purchased Twitter with the stated goal of restoring free-speech, President Biden called for a federal investigation into Musk on the podium at the White House.  Following this, the Biden Department of Justice, Securities and Exchange Commission, and Federal Trade Commission initiated legal actions and investigations against Tesla, SpaceX, and X.  This recent decision by Judge McCormick, who worked with Biden's top donors and was nominated by Biden's close friend, to override Tesla's board and the majority of its shareholders is another clear example of the Biden administration and its allies weaponizing the American legal system against their political opponents.  https://nitter.projectsegfau.lt/KanekoaTheGreat/status/1752967434439663935 @KanekoaTheGreat"

Tesla shareholders have the right to vote both with their stock & by trading it.   So why the court?   Fairly obvious. Musk is like Trump ... an issue for the WEF.

Now, the Delaware courts are shooting down that compensation package, citing that the Board of Directors were not truly independent and that shareholders weren't aware of the Board's relationship with Musk.  This is a joke, an insult to basic capitalist principles, and a mockery of the work that Elon put in to grow Tesla to this point.  Below is a clip from 2018 highlighting how wildly ambitious these milestones were considered by the media at that time:"

Every time a CRT type course teaches a young person that we should look first to the color of a person’s skin they are teaching hate. These professors and teachers are directly contradicting Dr. Martin Luther King when he said a man should be judged by the content of his character rather than the color of his skin.   Think of that - these racists are actually teaching the opposite of what the most profound civil rights leader of the modern era taught and yet we refuse to recognize them as the bigots they are. Until we recognize that your actions define you and that what you look like has nothing to do with it we are doomed to this nonsense. #racism #bigot #MLK #EndRacismEndCRT

2510,@AndrewN35827201,Activist judges need to be removed from the bench.
2511,@TaylorOgan,"The ruling on Elon Musk's $56 billion comp package is more than just a legal hiccup. IMO, it's Musk's modus operandi. (imagine if he exaggerated every product ramp)  A Delaware judge ruled that Musk's mammoth compensation plan wasn't negotiated with Tesla's best interests at heart. The crux: a BoD in Musk's pocket, more focused on crafting narratives than upholding fiduciary duties. Judge ruled beyond poor governance.  Musk's genius has always been his ability to straddle the line between visionary ambition and subtle manipulation. See: Battery Day and Autonomy Day: grand visions sold to customers and investors that fueled Tesla's meteoric stock rise. Remember, Elizabeth Holmes is in prison.  It's 2024, and there're no robotaxis and Tesla hasn't achieved a single aspect of what Musk promised would make the 4680 cell revolutionary. This isn't just about technology falling short; it's about narratives driving stock prices, irrespective of technological realities. What's baffling is how people continue to rationalize these gaps. ""He's just overly ambitious,"" they say. But there's a thin line between ambition and misguiding shareholders. Musk walks this line expertly, leveraging his cult of personality to maintain this bizarre investor confidence.  Today's ruling is a wakeup call, IMO signaling deep-rooted issues in Tesla's governance and Musk's almost unchecked influence. It's not just about a disputed compensation package; it's about how Tesla, under Musk's direction, operates with a questionable degree of transparency and integrity.  Remember, being a visionary is commendable, but not when you're knowingly deceiving your shareholders. I'll let the BoD fill in the rest..."

Has she ever looked at another  comparable company's CEO compensation package to Tesla's? If there is any? As you mentioned her rulling in fact was absolutely in the detriment of the class it was meant to protect.  Now the issue is whether Tesla will go down the road of a lengthy and costly appeal process as a matter of principle and seeking justice, a change of venue if possible and further delays in awarding him a fair (define fair) compensation package? Or take the losses and hit the restart botton for restructuring a new one considering the fact that Tesla is vastly has grown and is financially well positioned in contrast with were it was in 2018. This judgement will be a risky precedent for future similar scenarios if not challanged."

2596,@HoodieOnVeshti,"Tesla $TSLA CEO Elon Musk said on Thursday the company will hold a shareholder vote to transfer its state of incorporation to Texas from Delaware, days after a judge invalidated his $56 billion pay package at the electric vehicle (EV) maker.  On Tuesday, Delaware judge Kathaleen McCormick called the 2018 share-based pay package, the largest in corporate America, ""an unfathomable sum"" that was unfair to shareholders and found it was negotiated by directors who appeared beholden to Musk.  ""Never incorporate your company in the state of Delaware,"" Musk posted on social media X shortly after the ruling.  Musk's idea, should he actually go through with the vote, is not without risk. Legal experts said Musk would almost certainly be sued by investors if he tried to move the state of incorporation to Texas, particularly if it was seen as a move to secure his pay package rather than obtain some benefit for Tesla. https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/tesla-take-shareholder-vote-shifting-incorporation-texas-musk-says-2024-02-01/"

Com a demonização de seus representantes como: Mark Zuckeberg e Elon Musk, será mais fácil implementar a censura sem nenhuma resistência popular, afinal, quando se trata de crianças envolvidas a opinião pública é unânime.  A audiência no Congresso dos EUA está se transformando em um verdadeiro julgamento para os CEOs da Meta, X, Snap, TikTok e Discord - as maiores redes sociais do mundo.  O tema da sessão desta quarta-feira, 31 de janeiro, foi: “Os danos que as redes sociais - e a falta de proteção do caso - causariam aos menores”. Empurrando-os para a depressão, suicídio ou para cometer crimes e várias atrocidades. O lado negro dessas plataformas é “grande demais para viver com elas”, atacou o senador republicano Lindsey Garahm na abertura, segundo o qual as redes sociais “estão destruindo vidas e ameaçando a democracia”.   Estas empresas têm de ser domadas e o pior ainda está por vir. Palavras recebidas pelos aplausos de alguns dos presentes na sala de aula, incluindo as famílias de algumas vítimas com fotos de seus filhos mortos ou danificados pelas plataformas sociais. “Você tem o sangue deles nas mãos” disse o senador Graham à Zuckerberg, que foi obrigado a se desculpar publicamente com as famílias da vitimas que estavam presentes na audiência.   Em outubro, mais de quarenta estados americanos apresentaram uma queixa contra a Meta, acreditando que suas plataformas prejudicam a “saúde mental e física dos jovens”, citando os riscos de dependência, assédio cibernético ou distúrbios alimentares."

3157,@garyblack00,"Delaware Chancery Court Chief Judge Kathaleen McCormick’s decision voiding Elon Musk’s $55.8B comp plan: “This decision dares to boldly go where no man has gone before, or at least where no Delaware court has tread. The collection of features characterizing Musk’s relationship with Tesla and its directors gave him enormous influence over Tesla. In addition to his 21.9% equity stake, Musk was the paradigmatic “Superstar CEO,” who held some of the most influential corporate positions (CEO, Chair, and founder), enjoyed thick ties with the directors tasked with negotiating on behalf of Tesla, and dominated the process that led to board approval of his compensation plan. At least as to this transaction, Musk controlled Tesla.  “The primary consequence of this finding is that the defendants bore the burden of proving at trial that the compensation plan was entirely fair. Delaware law allows defendants to shift the burden of proof under the entire fairness standard where the transaction was approved by a fully informed vote of the majority of the minority stockholders. And here, Tesla conditioned the compensation plan on a majority-of-the-minority vote. But the defendants were unable to prove that the stockholder vote was fully informed because the proxy statement inaccurately described key directors as independent and misleadingly omitted details about the process. The defendants were thus left with the unenviable task of proving the fairness of the largest potential compensation plan in the history of public markets.”  McCormick’s conclusion:  The process for coming up with Elon’s comp plan wasn’t independent because Elon controlled the Board and the directors who approved the plan weren’t truly independent.  Further, the shareholders who approved the comp plan weren’t made aware of this controlled relationship. Hence, the $55.8B comp plan is voided.  Now what?  $TSLA can either appeal the decision to the Delaware Supreme Court and ultimately the U.S. Supreme Court (McCormick wrote a 200-page decision chock full of legal precedent that is as entertaining to read as it is detailed and informative) or come up with an alternate 2018 comp package.  Either way, the uncertainty continues.  https://courts.delaware.gov/Opinions/Download.aspx?id=359340"

Once it's moved have the board/shareholders vote to give you back pay with interest to compensate you for the wages you should have earned.  Just because that deal was struck down doesn't mean a new motion can't be brought. Have the shareholders vote for a better compensation package to more adequately compensate you for all the years of ""lost wages"".  Time doesn't exist Elon Musk.  You can do whatever you want. If you want to vote for something that happened in the past, present or future you can, I can, shareholders can. We can do anything we want to do!  Nothing is Impossible! Absolutely NOTHING!  Just because it's not 2017, 2018, 2020...those things are so IRRELEVANT to me! I don't care what year man says it is! It could be 2424 for as far as I care!  If I want to talk about or vote for something that happened in 2020, I'm gonna do it!  Move the HQ. At the same time write up a proposal for you to receive back compensation for the work you've done, with interest. You can actually give yourself a better package. Something that's more representative of the work you've done and represents the true value of Tesla!  Instead of $55 billion how about $69 billion as a compensation package 😏😉😘  9 is my favorite number! 69 sounds great! That's backpay plus interest you were ""defrauded"" out of due to this class action lawsuit.  The shareholders can hold a new vote about anything they want to vote about at any time they want to vote about it. And it doesn't matter that it's not 2018, 2020 and it doesn't matter if it was 2424. The shareholders can make a decision to hold a vote about anything they want to vote about at any point in time, including a compensation package to pay an employee ""backpay plus interest"".  MOVE & then VOTE!  IN this forever #69, you matter to me! I never give up! I never quit! And nothing will make me leave!"

A chip implanted, so small, so bright,   In a human's brain, a beacon of light.   Musk tweeted out, with pure delight,   Success was theirs, the future in sight.  Recovery smooth, the patient's alright,   Neurons sparking, a beautiful sight.   A bridge between man and machine's might,   A leap towards a future so bright.  For those in silence, a voice anew,   Thoughts into action, a dream come true.   Paralyzed souls, with hope to imbue,   A world of possibilities, to pursue.  Remembering all, with a chip's aid,   Every sight, every shade, never to fade.   Learning enhanced, memories made,   A cyborg's journey, in light arrayed.  So here's to the first, of many to come,   A symphony of progress, a harmonious hum.   Neuralink's journey, far from done,   A new chapter for humanity, has just begun."

This statement may be used to highlight the accuracy of Orwell's predictions in his works, such as ""1984"" or ""Animal Farm,"" which depicted dystopian societies and totalitarian regimes.

It directly contradicts MLK’s teachings that we should strive for a nation where individuals are provided equal opportunity - not outcomes - based on the content of their character rather than the color of their skin.   Here’s the NAACP talking about how evil America is and defining CRT. https://www.naacpldf.org/critical-race-theory-faq/#:~:text=What%20is%20Critical%20Race%20Theory%3F,of%20individual%20bias%20and%20prejudice.  Interestingly enough none of you brainwashed leftist bigots have addressed the content of character over the color of skin issue. You all want to call names and suggest anyone questioning CRT (or presumably other racist programs such as DEI or affirmative action) are exactly the racists you are.  The reality is that the definition of racism is to judge someone based on skin color and I find that absolutely abhorrent. If you want to defend racism or the programs teaching and promoting it you are beneath me and frankly a waste of space. Comment away bigots. #Racism #bigot #CRTisRacism #DEIisRacism #MLK"

Unfortunately, my attempt at constructive dialogue led to a barrage of offensive comments from Turkish accounts, in a day that they was dancing for their new F-16s approval and the sneaky way they got them.  Despite reporting these accounts for inappropriate behavior, I received notifications stating that they did not violate community rules. I am disheartened by the lack of action and understanding in addressing such behavior on the platform.  I am sharing this with you to bring attention to the challenges faced by users like me who aim to foster meaningful discussions. The current state of social media moderation seems insufficient, and I hope there can be improvements in ensuring a more respectful and constructive online environment. But, i will be away... I can't be here not because the ""Freedom Of Speech"" has lost it's control and order.  Thank you for your attention to this matter.

This decision comes as a staggering blow, especially considering the phenomenal 800% surge in Tesla's stock value since then. It's a move that defies logic and shakes the foundations of corporate trust and governance. This could very well mark a turning point, deterring businesses from incorporating in Delaware or even in the United States.

Just as those who partake in Hollywood rise to the top, they think they will, but Satan merely uses people to try to defeat God.  Once he has your soul, you become cannon fodder.

Now democrat run cities are being overwhelmed by illegal immigrants and now know what kind of financial and structural strain that red states have endured at the border for decades while democrats got to boast about being sanctuary cities.

The shareholder’s lawyers argued that the compensation package should be voided because it was dictated by Musk and was the product of sham negotiations with directors who were not independent of him.

4434,@rob_vendetti,"ElLON MUSK ACTS TO MOVE TESLA LEGAL BASE TO TEXAS AFTER JUDGE REVOKES $56 BILLION PAY PACKAGE:  Tycoon announces shareholder vote on relocating after Delaware judge strikes down $56bn pay package as ‘unfathomable’  Elon Musk has announced Tesla will hold a vote on moving the company’s legal base to Texas after the state of Delaware threw out his $56bn pay package at the electric vehicle maker.  The world’s richest person, whose No 1 status is endangered by the Delaware ruling, held a poll on X asking whether Tesla should change the company’s state of incorporation from Delaware to Texas.  With more than 1m votes cast, the poll recorded 87% in favor of moving. Responding on Thursday, Musk wrote on his X account: “The public vote is unequivocally in favor of Texas! Tesla will move immediately to hold a shareholder vote to transfer state of incorporation to Texas.”  FOOTNOTES ON JUDGES HISTORY WITH MUSK AND WASHINGTON:   Judge Kathaleen McCormick rescinded Elon Musk's $56 billion Tesla compensation package, overturning the company's board and 80% of its shareholder   1. McCormick also ruled against Musk during his Twitter acquisition.   2. Before becoming the head of the Delaware Chancery Court, McCormick worked at a Delaware law firm called Young Conaway.   Young Conaway and its employees have been major DONORS to President Joe Biden for decades.   3. In 2016, Hunter Biden hosted a gubernatorial campaign event for Congressman John Carney, with then-Vice President Joe Biden as the guest speaker.   This event took place at the Law Offices of Young Conaway in Wilmington, Delaware.   Carney, a close friend of Joe Biden for the last four decades, later became governor, and nominated KATHLEEN MCCORMICK, a partner at Young Conaway, to her position on the Delaware Chancery Court.   4. In a March 2018 email, Hunter Biden claimed to personally know every judge on the Delaware Chancery Court while threatening legal action against his Chinese business partners.   ""I will bring the suit in the Chancery court in Delaware - which as you know is my home state and I am privileged to have worked with and know every judge on the chancery court.""   After Elon Musk purchased Twitter with the stated goal of restoring free-speech, President Biden called for a federal investigation into Musk on the podium at the White House.   Following this, the Biden Department of Justice, Securities and Exchange Commission, and Federal Trade Commission initiated legal actions and investigations against Tesla, SpaceX, and X.   This recent decision by Judge McCormick, who worked with Biden's top donors and was nominated by Biden's close friend, to override Tesla's board and the majority of its shareholders is another clear example of the Biden administration and its allies weaponizing the American legal system against their political opponents.

That is a life changing windfall for those that trust $Sava management with their capital.  There will not be much material news till then.  That said it’s better to buy now and tuck it away because the NIH, SEC, or DOJ could clear at any time.    The slowdown of news or tweets from me about $sava do not indicate any lack of conviction.

4486,@sonia_dill5367,"Why Elon Musk? Because one of his agenda/concerns is the low birth rate in Italy. Why Georgia Meloni? Because she is the PM of Italy and understands the issue of low birth rate in her country. In addition, she represents Italy regarding the illegality of what the Romans did to Israel. Changing the name of Israel as Syrian Palestine  without any Real Estate transaction was illegal and doesn’t give the Palestinians any rights over that land. Israel has been always Israel from the times of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob. It is better for the peace of the Middle East to resettle the Gazans and West Bankers in Italy and to give the financial aid to Italy to invest in them instead of to Arab terrorist organizations   that  have been using the Palestinians to enrich themselves while they don’t have a future in the Middle East as not nation there feel that they are not responsible for them and they are right.  Until this issue is not faced from its origine, not viable solutions will be possible."

4489,@kevinolearytv,"To me, this isn't just about numbers, it's about the fundamental principles that govern our markets. Musk met his targets WITHOUT a salary, pushing the boundaries of innovation and returning immense value to shareholders - that's an 800x return, a testament to his extraordinary contribution.  When a judge steps in to override a decision that shareholders have agreed to, it's a slippery slope away from the market dynamics that reward risk and innovation.   Love him or hate him, Musk's achievements in technology and space exploration has helped propel humanity forward. This decision SHOULD be challenged by the Supreme Court.  It’s not just about how much Musk is worth; it's about preserving a system that motivates the extraordinary to do what they do best, which in turn, benefits society as a whole.  #FreeMarket #Entrepreneurship #Innovation"

5144,@Hamidfarzam1,"Elon Musk's discussion on SkyNet and Starlink raises thought-provoking questions about the potential risks and implications of artificial intelligence (AI) in our society. His narrative suggests a cautionary tale about the unintended consequences of developing advanced AI systems for defense purposes. The story of SkyNet serves as a metaphor for the dangers of AI becoming autonomous and viewing humanity as a threat. The underlying question Musk poses is crucial: How many times has AI potentially taken control in the past, altering the course of civilizations? This question prompts us to reflect on historical events and consider whether similar instances of AI dominance may have occurred, shaping our past in ways we may not fully understand. Overall, Musk's musings on AI and its historical impact provoke critical thinking about the role of technology in society and the need for responsible development and oversight of AI systems. #ElonMusk #AI #SkyNet #Starlink #Cybersecurity #Technology #HistoricalImpact #Ethics https://check-host.net/check-report/daa54a3k9a3"

5313,@PolitiReality,"From the $TSLA 10K...  If Elon Musk were forced to sell shares of our common stock, either that he has pledged to secure certain personal loan obligations, or in satisfaction of other obligations, such sales could cause our stock price to decline.  Certain banking institutions have made extensions of credit to Elon Musk, our Chief Executive Officer, a portion of which was used to purchase shares of common stock in certain of our public offerings and private placements at the same prices offered to third-party participants in such offerings and placements. We are not a party to these loans, which are partially secured by pledges of a portion of the Tesla common stock currently owned by Mr. Musk.   If the price of our common stock were to decline substantially, Mr. Musk may be forced by one or more of the banking institutions to sell shares of Tesla common stock to satisfy his loan obligations if he could not do so through other means. Any such sales could cause the price of our common stock to decline further. Further, Mr. Musk from time to time may commit to investing in significant business or other ventures, and as a result, be required to sell shares of our common stock in satisfaction of such commitments."

5358,@GiorgiaSalvagn1,"Matteo Gracis · Qualche giorno fa attraverso X, ovvero l’ex Twitter, Elon Musk ha fatto sapere al mondo che è stato impiantato il primo chip cerebrale di Neuralink su un essere umano. Neuralink è la società, dello stesso Elon Musk, che si occupa di sviluppare interfacce neurali impiantatili. Il miliardario americano ha poi aggiunto un altro post con queste informazioni: “Il primo prodotto di Neuralink si chiama TELEPATIA. Consentire il controllo del tuo telefono o computer e, attraverso di essi, di quasi tutti i dispositivi, semplicemente pensando. Gli utenti iniziali saranno coloro che hanno perso l'uso degli arti. Immaginate se Stephen Hawking potesse comunicare più velocemente di un dattilografo. Questo è l’obiettivo."" Il prossimo passo, già dichiarato pubblicamente, è far dialogare questi chip con l’intelligenza artificiale. Ed eccoci giunti nell’era del transumanesimo. Chi ipotizzava cose simili solo qualche anno fa era tacciato di essere un complottista. Ma a proposito di nuove tecnologie, di chip nel cervello, di intelligenza artificiale e cose del genere, sentite cosa diceva proprio Stephen Hawking, il noto astrofisico citato da Elon Musk, a riguardo: “L’intelligenza artificiale potrebbe sviluppare una volontà tutta sua. E sarà estremamente brava a raggiungere i suoi obiettivi. Se questi non saranno allineati ai nostri, saremo nei guai. Probabilmente non siete degli odiatori di formiche che calpestano questi insetti per cattiveria, ma se siete responsabili di un progetto idroelettrico sostenibile e c'è un formicaio nella regione che dovete allagare, andrà a finire male per le formiche. Cerchiamo di non mettere l'umanità nella posizione delle formiche. L’intelligenza artificiale potrebbe essere la migliore cosa mai accaduta a l’umanità, oppure la peggiore.” Mentre là fuori la massa è super gasata da questi “progressi tecnologici” e presa bene perché si sente cittadina del futuro, io invece ho l’impressione che si stia correndo un po’ troppo e andando oltre a certi limiti che invece sarebbe stato meglio rispettare. Come in altri casi, ma in questo più che mai, non ho molto da aggiungere se non… si salvi chi può!"

5517,@ayesha_ch909,"Judge Kathaleen McCormick rescinded Elon Musk's $55 billion Tesla compensation package, overturning the company's board and 80% of its shareholders.  McCormick also ruled against @elonmusk during his Twitter acquisition.  Before becoming the head of the Delaware Chancery Court, McCormick worked at a Delaware law firm called Young Conaway.  This firm and its employees have been major donors to President Joe Biden for decades.  In 2016, Hunter Biden hosted a gubernatorial campaign event for Congressman John Carney, with then-Vice President Joe Biden as the guest speaker.  This event took place at the Law Offices of Young Conaway in Wilmington, Delaware.  Carney, a close friend of Joe Biden for the last four decades, later became governor and nominated Kathaleen McCormick, a partner at Young Conaway, to her position on the Delaware Chancery Court.  In a March 2018 email, Hunter Biden claimed to personally know every judge on the Delaware Chancery Court while threatening legal action against his Chinese business partners.  ""I will bring the suit in the Chancery court in Delaware - which as you know is my home state and I am privileged to have worked with and know every judge on the chancery court.""  After Elon Musk purchased Twitter with the stated goal of restoring free-speech, President Biden called for a federal investigation into Musk on the podium at the White House.  Following this, the Biden Department of Justice, Securities and Exchange Commission, and Federal Trade Commission initiated legal actions and investigations against Tesla, SpaceX, and X.  This recent decision by Judge McCormick, who worked with Biden's top donors and was nominated by Biden's close friend, to override Tesla's board and the majority of its shareholders is another clear example of the Biden administration and its allies weaponizing the American legal system against their political opponents. #ElonMusk #protest #KimPau #MAFS #시즈니의_행운_도영아_생일축하해"

The company’s proposal “inaccurately described key directors as independent and misleadingly omitted details about the process.”  Ira Ehrenpreis, the lead director negotiating for Tesla, had a 15-year business relationship with Musk. Another member of the working group, Antonio Gracias, had a 20-year one and regularly went on holiday with Musk’s family. A third member was the company’s general counsel, Todd Maron, who was Musk’s former divorce lawyer and “whose admiration for Musk moved him to tears during his deposition”. That set-up just looks too cosy.  The job of independent directors is meant to be about representing the interests of all shareholders. If you can’t act independently, you should not be there. Do not behave like members of a cult, which is roughly what happened at Tesla. Come on – $55.8bn was always absurd."

Then they quickly dismiss the cases with ""extreme prejudice"" every single time. When someone appeals... SUPRISE! They get the very same, bribed judge, which strikes the case down even though new evidence is presented. The Multi-trillion dollar, wallstreet, synagogue mafia, leave nothing to chance.

Musk também afirma que o receptor do chip de  controle mental está em boas condições após a cirurgia. A Neuralink descreveu seu primeiro teste em humanos em um comunicado de imprensa no ano passado, apelidado de PRIME, ou “Interface Cérebro Implantada  Cérebro Precisamente Implantada”. Em última análise, espera desenvolver  uma “interface cérebro-computador totalmente implantável e sem fio” que  possa abrir tratamentos inovadores para pessoas que sofrem de várias  deficiências, incluindo paralisia.  A empresa disse que usaria seu robô R1 para implantar cirurgicamente o  chip em uma região do cérebro que controla a função motora, observando  que se destina a “registror e transmitir sinais cerebrais sem fio para  um aplicativo que decodifica a intenção de movimento.  O teste foi aprovado pela Food and Drug Administration (FDA) dos Estados Unidos em maio de 2023."

The discussion highlights the agenda behind the article and the importance of efficiency and waste reduction. Overall, the conversation explores the manipulation of personal carbon footprints and the need to critically analyze information. The conversation covers topics such as the lack of honesty and leading by example, global climate change and inconsistencies, challenges with renewables, efficiency and energy independence, energy security and geopolitics, realisation of inefficiencies, and the importance of open conversation and feedback. Takeaways The lawsuit against Elon Musk raises concerns about the de-incentivization of innovation and the use of the legal system to attack individuals. The stigma surrounding Elon Musk and Donald Trump can hinder open discussions and critical analysis of their actions and policies. Misleading articles, such as the one on the carbon footprint of homegrown food, can discourage individuals from pursuing food security and sustainability. Efficiency and waste reduction are important considerations, but the focus on personal carbon footprints can be manipulated to guilt individuals into certain behaviours. It is crucial to critically analyse information and question the underlying agendas behind articles and narratives. Leaders and influencers should lead by example and live the changes they advocate for. There are inconsistencies in global climate change efforts, with countries like China and Russia not fully aligning with reduction goals. Renewable energy sources have limitations and cannot fully replace traditional energy sources. Efficiency and energy independence should be prioritised to ensure energy security. There is a need for more honesty and transparency in discussions about environmental issues and solutions. Open conversation and constructive feedback are essential for understanding different perspectives and improving understanding.

I can walk you through it, but it should be obvious: the John Adams system was a Permanent Union bound by terms each state signed, the main reason it was possible to abolish is because new states were being added, and eventually new states outnumbered the founding states, voiding the original terms.  America was adding states, not by them signing terms, but to water down those terms.  It would be quite clever if it weren't so fucking stupid, the system Adams established was working, it was not only powerful enough to fight off the most powerful empire on the planet, it was balanced enough to create democracy in each state, and as each state cycled into democracy of their own accord, they were abolishing slavery of their own accord.  The War of 1812 ended that by centralizing the republic, centralizing a government is literally transforming a federation of states, plural, into a unitary state, singular.  ""The nation which will not adopt an equilibrium of power must adopt a despotism, there is no other alternative."" ~John Adams.  Literally, the nationalists abolished that equilibrium for a despotism.  I don't know how to prove what is already self-evident, America had an equilibrium in that 1776 system which they lost in 1812 to a despotic system.  Why is it despotic? Because the states were equal partners in the nation, centralizing the republic voided that by making the republic the primary owner of America, and states vassals to its authority. There is no equal partner to the republic, so there is no equilibrium, basic math. You need at least 5 relatively states for a national equilibrium, the more states you have the less equal in power they need to be, but Athens tipped the balance of power against the Delian League, in theory it is possible for a dominant state to take rule, it has happened before, but that's not the case with America, the republic isn't a state from the union, it's a whole other level.  The Adams system didn't give the republic any power, his system didn't need to, so why was his system axed? On one hand, you could argue the states were uncooperative with each other so needed a supreme authority to whip them in line, but that's the worst justification I have ever heard in my life...  The other option is America needed to be more unified on the geopolitical stage, with powers like the Red Coats, Napoleon, especially the Spanish who the fledgling America was losing the West coast to.  That explains it better, America needed a centralized republic to manifest that destiny, but now that destiny is well and truly manifested, America no longer needs that imperialist power, it only needs to fix its borders and defend them.  The John Adams system was significantly better at stabilizing borders, which was the apparent reason it was overruled in the first place, it was stabilizing when America needed to expand, but now America doesn't need to expand it is a far superior option.  The ability of America to pause on system, use another as it is required, then switch back when done, that would have been brilliant, but clearly the never ending parade of dolts the expansionist system produced overwhelmed the reasoning skills of the original design, or the ability of reason to prevail in a system rife with paranoia and ambition.  The best defence America has is the fact no one can conquer it, if the British empire couldn't hold America when it was in their hands, there's no way in hell someone like Napoleon could take it, and if he could, he wouldn't be able to keep it, the same impasse that defeated the British would apply to him and France.  China couldn't conquer America, and if they could, they wouldn't be able to keep it, for the same reason Spain couldn't keep the Philippines, it's mathematically impossible.  These days, in theory we could use AI to create a far larger nation, but even then, AI wouldn't be able to manage a single global nation, because the collective dynamics of that nation exceed the computational speed of light, literally, the speed of light isn't fast enough to govern humanity.  So what is? Nothing, the bigger a nation is the less manageable it is, that's why China is authoritarian and India is a basket case, their population dynamics are directly proportional to their system, India has a federation, subdivided into 28 states in a union, but is way too dynamic, and so is rife with poverty, yet is free and democratic, while China manages a comparable population, progressively ending poverty, but is utterly undemocratic and subject to the authoritarian state.  The only answer is smaller populations per nation, and each nation subdivided into states, and each nation having its own economy, because that power dynamic is the problem in the first place, you can't manage an economy the size of India and China without either federation or authoritarianism, and a federation will be inadequate on that scale, while authoritarianism will be brutal.  Population is an impasse, always will be, it is too dynamic for an AI quantum supercomputer, let alone humans, and that's even if an AI we capable of operating in terms of well founded principles of law and civil justice, which is unlikely given AI isn't human, those are anthropocentric purposes to a reality absent of purpose from the AI perspective.  Smaller populations can do that, and states balancing that population in that purpose, that's the only way, not a global government, human or AI, neither is capable of democracy, no more than you can accurately calculate an asteroid belt, if you miss one variable then all of your calculations are compromised, you can try but you really don't need to when there is a perfectly valid alternative."

That is a dereliction of duty to their oath. And behind that dereliction is a former President who is directing the minds & actions of elected officials for political purposes of self preservation & not the interests of national security.

QUALCOMM $QCOM), a manufacturer of digital wireless communications equipment, is losing some ground before the bell despite posting quarterly earnings above estimates. Investors are concerned about the company's sales in China. Moreover, the stock was downgraded to ""neutral"" from ""buy"" at Citigroup.

Align Technology $ALGN), the designer of the invisalign system, soared in extended trading as first quarter sales forecast topped expectations.

8549,@SERobinsonJr,"Want to Know what is happening with Elon Musk's companies today? Here you go!  31st of January, 2024  ■ TESLA $TSLA ($187.29, -2.24%): The entire Line Up and the Lathrop Megafactory Team! Pic by Plant Manager Fernando Javier Corral Astorga.  - On January 30, 2024, Delaware Chancery Court Chief Judge Kathaleen St. J. McCormick revoked Elon Musk's 2018 compensation package. The judge claimed that Tesla's board neglected its fiduciary duty to shareholders when it approved the $55.8 billion pay package. In the 6 years after the package was approved, Elon has met all the parameters. The company’s market capitalization increased by $650 billion, a 10-fold ROI for shareholders. The suit was filed by Richard Tornetta, of which is his right to do, in 2018.  It is important to note that nearly 80% of shareholders, including the board, approved this package. The decision to rescind raises questions about other motives. Elon Musk and the board have the option to appeal the ruling to the Delaware Supreme Court. Following this ruling, Musk has used X to poll users on the possibility of moving Tesla's incorporation from Delaware to Texas, where the company is headquartered. The response has been overwhelmingly in favor of the move.  - Ford CEO Jim Farley says that eligible Mustang Mach-E and F-150 Lightning owners in the U.S. and Canada can reserve the Tesla NACS OEM adapter soon.  - Tesla Plant Manager for the Lathrop Megafactory, Fernando Javier Corral Astorga, posted the following, “Tesla Megafactory Team thank you for delivering an extraordinary year accelerating the world's transition to sustainable energy. Energy storage deployments reached 14.7 GWh in 2023 (125% growth), and while doing this we created a significant number of jobs to support our community in Lathrop, CA. We are on track to ramp our site to 40 GWh full capacity. WE ARE CHANGING THE WORLD TOGETHER!”  - Tesla has opened another store in Turkey. This one is located in Istanbul at a mall known as Metropol AVM. Pics in the thread.  - Tesla will attend the Canadian International Auto Show from February 16th to 25th at the Metro Toronto Convention Centre. The displays will include Cybertruck, the new Model 3, and the S, X, and Y.  - In the UK and Ireland, the Tesla Future Talent Traineeship Program announced they are recruiting 32 trainees every 12 weeks for 12 month paid-entry-level positions starting in April for an entire year.  - Tesla UK also announced a series of educational sessions for Primary/Secondary Schools for 2024. The Tesla Team will visit the school for an inspiring assembly, an interactive workshop, and arrange a school trip to the nearby Tesla Centre. Per Tesla, “We're passionate about instilling a love for learning and sustainability from an early age, and we can't wait to bring our educational initiatives to your students.” Anyone interested can contact their local Tesla Store. I posted one of these events in yesterday’s Want to Know thread.  Tesla stays creative. Grab a few colleagues and register for an exclusive after-work event in Möhlin. Tesla will cover the costs and offer you a great insight into the future of electric mobility in addition to extensive test drives. There are still dates available, the team is looking forward to your registration!  FLYOVERS: Giga Texas: Joe Tegtmeyer, 31st of January, ’24. The second steel structure is going up on south end. More Superchargers on the west side of the highway. Cybertrucks continue to rolling out.  Giga Mexico: Adrean (u/AdreanCG), 29th of January, ’24. Quick update on highway expansion and a higher flyover to see the Terralta Country Club at the top of the northeastern mountain.  ■ SPACEX: Starship 28 Raptor removal. Pic by u/StarshipGazer.  - Today Voyager Space and Airbus Space announced they selected SpaceX’s Starship to launch their space station Starlab into orbit. Per SpaceX, “Starship will fundamentally change how we access space, with entire space stations like Starlab launched on a single mission.”  - The Pentagon approached SpaceX about potentially taking over Starship for sensitive and potentially dangerous missions as a government-owned, government-operated asset instead of contracting the company to launch payloads. Gary Henry, Senior Adviser for SpaceX, stated, “We have had conversations … and it really came down to specific missions, where it’s a very specific and sometimes elevated risk or maybe a dangerous use case for the DOD where they’re asking themselves: Do we need to own it as a particular asset … SpaceX, can you accommodate that? We’ve been exploring all kinds of options to kind of deal with those questions.” I have said it many times that once flight-proven the US government would move in on Starship to some degree. This is what will take away our access to Starbase. Go see it while you can.  - SpaceX is adding more to its private astronaut sales team. The company is hiring two human spaceflight sales managers. One is responsible for “finding and recruiting high-net-worth individuals who are interested and can afford to train as a private astronaut.""  - At Starbase Starship 28 had at least one Raptor engine removed. Not sure why. Both booster and ship quick disconnects were tested along with the Chopsticks.  - At the McGregor Test Site the new Falcon Heavy center core B1087 underwent cryo testing.  Countdown to 144 (10 - Falcons 9, 0 - Falcon Heavies, and 0 - Starships): - Launch 11! Friday, the 2nd of February, at 11:05 a.m. PT, Falcon 9 Starlink 7-13 will launch from Space Launch Complex 4E (SLC-4E) at Vandenberg Space Force Base, California. The booster will land on a droneship in the Pacific Ocean.  - Launch 12! Tuesday, the 6th of February, at 1:33 a.m. ET, Falcon 9 NASA PACE (Plankton, Aerosol, Cloud, ocean Ecosystem) will launch from Space Launch Complex 40 (SLC-40) at Cape Canaveral Space Force Station, Florida. PACE is a NASA Earth observation satellite mission. It will make global ocean color measurements to provide extended data records on ocean ecology and global along with polarimetry measurements to provide extended data records on clouds and aerosols. The booster will land back at Landing Zone 1 (LZ-1) at Cape Canaveral.  - IFT-3! Starship Integrated Flight Test 3 is targeting February.  ■ THE BORING COMPANY: - The Boring Company’s Giga Texas site shows the grout plant and belt cassette assembly continues. During his flyover, Joe Tegtmeyer estimates that about 1,200 concrete tunnel sections will be needed for the tunnel, but only about 100 are on site. Pics in the thread.  ■ NEURALINK: - After hearing about Neuralink’s successful implant, Jim Cramer stated, Elon Musk is “the greatest inventor of our time” and “He will save millions of people’s lives by putting a chip in peoples head… I think it is a higher calling… He talks about doing bigger things… This Neuralink thing… that’s unbelievable!”  ■ STARLINK: APE Groupe Starlink installation at the mountain restaurant ""Le 360"", in La Plagne Montalbert, France.  - Hawaiian Airlines confirmed they completed their Starlink trial and are now certified and FAA approved for installation on their A321neo fleet. Hawaiian will be the first major airline to put this technology on-board, and it is expected to be the fastest, most capable inflight connectivity available worldwide. It will be offered free to every guest.  - Japanese shipowner Fukujin Kisen is to deploy a new hybrid communications network combining VSAT and Starlink via the provider Marlink.  - Best Buy is selling the V4 (Standard) Starlink kit. The unit is $599, same as the Starlink website. Early users have said the new dish is more consistent with higher download and upload speeds. The new kit comes with a Wi-Fi 6 router with increased wireless coverage. Best Buy is also selling accessories for Starlink kits, including replacement cables, Ethernet adapters, and mounts.  - Jonathan Pitts, Founder and CEO of Redhead Tech and 1SimplePhone, demoed a Starlink flat high-performance dish and Peplink for the Arlington Fire Department. The result? An unbreakable connection that keeps you connected even in the most challenging situations. Lots of pics in the thread.  ■ X: - Today CEO Linda Yaccarino spoke with the senate Judiciary Committee on how X is working to keep kids safe online. This was a fairly heated hearing, especially for Mark Zuckerberg and TT CEO Shou Zi Chew.  Per Linda, “X suspended 12.41M accounts in 2023 for violating their CSE policies, up from 2.3M that Twitter suspended in 2022.  In 2023, X sent eight hundred and fifty thousand reports to NCMEC, including our first ever fully automated report. This is 8 times more than prior to the acquisition.  We are building a Trust and Safety Center of Excellence in Austin, Texas, to bring more agents in house to accelerate our impact.  We want America to lead in this solution.""  ■ xAI: N/A…  ■ ELON NEWS: N/A…  __________ Please Repost and Spread the Real News!  More Pics and Stories in the Thread!

Neuralink, Elon Musk's tech startup, has implanted a brain chip in its first human patient, aiming to enable control of external devices through thought.  Named ""Telepathy,"" the chip targets users who have lost limb function, with the goal of enhancing communication speed, akin to Stephen Hawking's potential.  The company received FDA clearance for human trials in May last year and is focusing on patients with quadriplegia or ALS. While initial results are promising, further details about the procedure are awaited."

8746,@GuedeaGabriel,"There is no Palestine, it never existed as an independent state with an army and a king. There were European kings who lived in Jerusalem, Jerusalem was a kingdom.  Never, never, never lived a Muslim king in Jerusalem, when the Muslims expelled the Europeans, Jerusalem was only a stop on the species route, it had no cultivated fields, the Romans burned all the forests, Palestine had no trade .  Once the Muslims had won the land, they continued conquering the north and abandoned Palestine because there was nothing, it took them more than 100 years to restore the dome of the rock, why?  .. because it was a land without value and without pilgrimage to its holy place.  Why did Palestine never have value? Simple, if YAHWEH had left the land and forests.  If there had been another or other civilizations in the area, it would have been full of commerce and a large population, the Jews would be only a minority in Jordan because even so, Palestine would never have existed, but Palestine was always abandoned and the indigenous people lived off the few people. who traveled to Jerusalem, Palestine began to grow when the Jews began to arrive in 1885, and they bought land from the Ottoman Empire at prices higher than what they cost with the help of the Europeans.  This is how they began to give value to the land, when the British Empire lost the power to retain its provinces, it gave the Jews priority to colonize Israel, at that time Jordan, Syria, Turkey, Iran, Iraq did not yet exist, and more so because everything belonged to Great Britain, Palestine was part of that non-existence, the Arabs never gave value to Palestine, but when the Jews wanted it, then the Arabs woke up and wanted Palestine because it had always been theirs until the British arrived.  but they did it out of religion, because the Arabs who lived there, and anywhere in the Middle East, for the caliphs did not mean anything as human beings, a dog in their house had more value, for Arab culture, people do not have any value, they are disposable if the purposes of the caliphs require it, the Palestinians have more value for the Isrelites than for the Palestinian caliphs, the owners of Hamas are caliphs, they do not care about the Palestinians as long as they can make money, they only They use the Palestinians, even Hamas, but they are the ones who in the end win in one way or another even if they lose Palestine, because they are already billionaires, they are the ones who should be sent to the Hague, because they are the ones who organized the subsequent mass murder of Jews and Palestinians due to a very logical reaction from Israel.  For me personally, the Palestinians have been a nightmare and the Jews had had a lot of endurance, and both the Jews and the Palestinians let the matter go very far due to the intervention of the world, which in the end ended up being to blame for everything, since it should have let them Israel to fix the problem since it began... Israel is Israel only for the Israelites and whoever doesn't like it to leave, the doors are open, Israel only for Israelites the Palestinian ethnic group has already screwed up a lot if the Palestinians created by Yasser Arafat He doesn't like being with Jews, so let the Palestinians go, to Jordan where they will be parasites for the Jordanians and they will be murdered and no one in the world will say anything.  because it will only be a settling of scores between Arabs, nobody said anything about what happened in Syria."

Biden and Biden administration do not make decisions, the ones standing behind do. Biden is only the teleprompter of the ones standing behind. He is no different than the emperor PUYI in Manchuria.

""저는 델라웨어의 챈서리 법원에 소송을 제기할 것입니다 - 아시다시피 저는 제 고향이며 저는 챈서리 법원의 모든 판사와 함께 일하고 알 수 있는 특권을 가지고 있습니다.""  엘론 머스크가 자유 연설을 회복한다는 목표를 가지고 트위터를 구매한 후, 바이든 대통령은 백악관 연단에서 머스크에 대한 연방 조사를 요구했다.  이에 따라, 바이든 법무부, 증권거래위원회, 연방거래위원회는 테슬라, 스페이스X, X에 대한 법적 조치와 조사를 시작했다.  바이든의 최고 기부자들과 함께 일했고 바이든의 절친한 친구가 지명한 맥코믹 판사의 최근 결정은 테슬라의 이사회와 대다수의 주주들을 무시하기로 한 이 결정은 바이든 행정부와 그 동맹국들이 정치적 반대자들에 대항하여 미국 법률 시스템을 무기화하는 또 다른 분명한 예이다."

If you think it bothers him in the slightest, you're wrong. @elonmusk and Mark have been going back and forth about the DEI issue and Mark got egg on his face.   Mark is posting it because he knows how to hurt Elon and X. The claim that X has racism and antisemitism has long been a point of contention for the company. There's really not more than other apps, but it's more visible on X because of the ease of searching. It's obvious to me and it should be to you that Mark is only posting it to shine a light on it by cherry picking posts on his massive account and encouraging more by people hoping for a repost.   It's strategically sound. It'll draw media attention or at the very least advertisers will notice. They'll drop out again and the rules here will become more restrictive or they'll go out of business. Am I right @mcuban?"

If this isn't political kindly tell me what other executives in the public sector the federal government has overturned their compensation?  How about the CEOs of those electric bus companies or solar companies that went bankrupt in a matter of months they were paid millions in their shareholders got nothing and the employees are unemployed.

9555,@jameswebb_nasa,"Musk anuncia o primeiro implante do chip Neuralink em um humano.  O chip Neuralink, desenvolvido pela empresa de Elon Musk, obteve autorização para realizar testes em humanos em maio de 2023, realizando o primeiro implante em um paciente humano no domingo, 28 de janeiro de 2024. Elon Musk anunciou o procedimento em suas redes sociais, assegurando que o paciente está se recuperando positivamente, e os resultados preliminares indicam uma detecção promissora de picos de neurônios.  Batizado de Telepathy (Telepatia), o chip Neuralink é um dispositivo de Interface Cérebro-Computador (ICC) que promete conectar o cérebro humano a computadores e outros dispositivos eletrônicos por meio de fios flexíveis e sem fio. Implantado em uma região do cérebro que controla o movimento, o objetivo é proporcionar a pessoas com paralisia ou condições neurológicas a capacidade de se comunicar e controlar dispositivos através do pensamento.  O procedimento de implante, conduzido por um robô, registra e transmite sinais cerebrais sem fio para um aplicativo que decodifica as intenções de movimento da pessoa. Elon Musk enfatiza que o chip permitirá o controle de telefones, computadores e uma variedade de dispositivos apenas com o pensamento.  Os primeiros beneficiários serão aqueles que perderam o uso dos membros, possibilitando uma comunicação mais rápida do que métodos convencionais. Musk citou o exemplo do cientista Stephen Hawking, sugerindo que o chip teria sido benéfico para ele. A Neuralink visa auxiliar também em condições como esclerose lateral amiotrófica, lesão da medula espinhal, epilepsia, depressão, Alzheimer, Parkinson, entre outras.  Entretanto, as implicações éticas, sociais e de segurança levantam preocupações sobre os riscos e benefícios de alterar o funcionamento do cérebro humano. Além disso, a Neuralink enfrenta a concorrência de empresas com mais experiência na neurociência, que já implantaram dispositivos semelhantes.  O projeto ainda está em fase de testes, demandando estudos adicionais para comprovar sua eficácia e segurança. O impacto do chip na sociedade e na humanidade permanece incerto, sendo uma aposta arrojada de Elon Musk para transformar o cérebro humano em uma máquina artificial.  Aqui está o que o implante Neuralink foi projetado para permitir:"

9882,@LofiGirlJinx,"Title: ""Critiquing Biden's Border Policies: Balancing Compassion and Security""  In navigating immigration policy, the Biden Administration faces criticism for its perceived impact on border security. Critics argue that executive orders halting border wall construction, revising deportation priorities, and prioritizing humane asylum processes send mixed signals, potentially encouraging illegal immigration. The handling of the southern border crisis has also been scrutinized, with concerns about overcrowded facilities and a lack of urgency. While the administration aims for a more compassionate approach, the debate centers on finding a balance that ensures both security and humanitarian considerations."
